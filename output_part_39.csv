The product broke broke down just after 1 year when the warranty had expired and they won't replace it. The coffee maker is poor quality, it leaks and has a software issue where it won't brew a cup without stopping because of lights blinking and making sounds. Woke us up one night."
"The device is visually appealing, makes a great pot of coffee. The water reservoir is nice as you can remove it for easy filling. The coffee pot insert is removable for easy cleaning. The Nespresso pod side is easy to use and maintain. I do like this device but was sorely disappointed in the Nespresso pods. It just simply is not that strong. I have to use 3 pods to sort of get a decent enough flavor for mochas/lattes/cappuccino. Even then you gotta be wary of volume of milk used. Too much and you just burned 3 pods for nothing.I find myself considering getting something else just to make those fancy espresso drinks.If you are considering this for Nespresso and making nice coffee shop drinks at home. Forget about it. Seriously. My wife and I considered returning the device.*Update. Has a major electrical issue. Have had it a little over a year and it will turn off mid brew or it randomly turn on and cycle through the brew settings. I have had a few coffee makers and this one died the quickest. Not impressed for the amount spent."
Overall its not bad but with the actual Nespresso not enough creama and not quite as strong as I would like it to be.
"I rarely write reviews this bad. Do not buy this. I am on my third machine. Way past return eligible and coming close to the end of the warranty when it will have to go in the trash. Each machine worked for a few months and then the ""add water"" error message starts.  Either the part the pierces open the nespresso pods stops working or the mechanism that holds the pod in place breaks. I'm not sure but the plastic is cheap and once that starts no amount of cleaning cycles will make it better. Others online have complained about the same but it seemed like the minority so I still bought it and am now realizing I was fooled by reviews that were written when they hadn't had the machine long enough yet."
Everything works well and comes out nice and hot UNLESS you make a coffee size smaller than 28oz. Every time I have made an 18oz coffee or smaller it comes out luke warm. Pretty disappointed that I paid that much money for this kind of flaw.

The machine has stopped puncturing the Nespresso c pods and just yields water.  It is not even a year old.  I tried different brands (Lavazza and Peets) with the same result.Update: I called customer service and they are replacing the machine.  I cannot in good conscience change the products overall rating unless the replacement product performs adequately for a reasonable amount of time. I am not rating customer service, which was excellent, I am rating the machine.  Will update, if the replacement product performs adequately."
"Hasn’t worked in a few weeks. Support hasn’t done anything and it’s still freaking out. Won’t do a cleaning cycle, won’t let us brew either kind of coffee as it shuts off."

Bought this ""high quality"" coffee machine and after 18 months the espresso side only dispenses hot water with a drop of espresso from the pods - the espresso pod side stopped working all togeher. Tried fixing it and company said we should just get a new one. Don't buy this one grt a machine that will last longer."
"I wanted to love this machine. Coffee brews nice and strong and tastes great, although it isn't as hot as I'd prefer. the milk frother works great too! I warmed up some milk, whipped it up and went to add some espresso..I popped in a peets coffee pod made for the original nespresso machine, and voila....NOTHING but hot water. Took it out, it was not punctured at all. Tried three more times with nothing. So I am sending it back AND will be without a coffee maker until I get a replacement. Super disappointed."
"First, Amazon delivered the wrong product. This was our wedding gift to ourselves and we were so excited to get back from our honeymoon but they had delivered something else. After going through the return process and using the refund money to get a new machine we liked it a lot, but 4 months in, we would go to brew a pot of coffee, the machine would lose power and completely reset. I would have to sit there for 10+ minutes trying to get it to work. I am so dissapointed that they would sell such an expensive machine and I am reading that a lot of people are having the same issue. My husband has already deactivated his prime account and I fear that due to the amount of issues I have had in the past few months, I also will be no longer using Amazon."
"I bought this after having experienced 12-cup thermal-carafe coffee makers at two of my stepkids' homes.  The ability to not have a glass carafe, and have hot coffee for my typical consumption of the full 12 cups, over a typical ~2-hour period, without having to worry about scorching the coffee appealed to me greatly.Both of those households liked their coffee considerably stronger than I, and so very fully filled their (in both cases) gold-mesh filters, one each round and cone style.  So it was with considerable surprise that my 4-heaping-tablespoon-scoops coffee load (first picture) resulted in:Every single time, my brew basket came out looking like the second or third picture.  I brewed every single day I owned this machine (returning it for refund on the last possible day, 34 pots later).  Never was there no grounds in the basket.  Sometimes a few, and ...Sometimes a lot, resulting in the top of the carafe looking like the 4th picture.  I can't imagine what the outcome of putting in 12 tablespoons (nominally at least twice the load of my heaping tablespoon-scoop) would have been.Never was any potful free of drips.  Sometimes, a LOT of drips.  The most egregious of them looked like the last two pictures.  It got to the point where I was NEVER without a folded paper towel next to my mug in order to catch the drips.I did everything I could think of to eliminate the drips.  Tilt the pot, and THEN push the pouring seal.  Push the pouring seal and THEN pour.  Scrub the gasket between the top and the pot, and the gasket between the on/off pouring seal.  The  best I ever achieved was a few drips down the front of the pot.  The worst is in the pictures.That's all the negative stuff.The coffee was great.  The pot, lid, and basket were easy to clean.  If I didn't mind the occasional instance of grounds in my coffee, or having to clean up every single time I brewed, sometimes several times in the 4 pours (my mug is a full pint, also insulated), the inevitable drips, I likely would have kept it, as the coffee was fine.A minor nuisance was that the water tank was a bit difficult to fill accurately without paying very strict attention, as the spray unit divided the width exactly in half, making a relatively small target for the full carafe.As I followed the recommendation of the owner's manual and preheated the carafe before brewing, I never actually used the preset/overnight-ready setup; in fact, I stowed it in the cabinet directly over where I brewed, so it always displayed a flashing 12:00 - but I expect it would have worked as intended.I (obviously) have no idea why the carafe leaked or whatever-other-mechanism caused my drip issues.  But I'm certain I could not have improved the coffee grounds issue, given my care in leveling my load, and the fact that it was perhaps a third of the normal load for the 12-cup brew I did each time.  The only way I can conceive for that failure is that the drain wasn't sufficiently large.I admit that, not having had an endoscope to sneak in during brewing I never got to see the effects of the multi-directional spray bar; I'd thought it a fantastic idea and it was one of the reasons I purchased this model.  It may have been that the pressure was a bit too much and caused splashing of the grounds, but the very even level of the empty-of-water basket suggests otherwise, and that it simply overflowed the filter paper.One other niggle.  As you can see, I have a wide-bottomed insulated mug.  It's a leftover from my 15 years of cruising on a sailboat.  So old that it's unobtanium now, and I've made it safe to use with an electrical tie reinforcement to the handle.  But I digress...  The subject pot gave me 4 cupfuls - the usual ""12 cups"" - if you count leaving a half-inch or so space at the top on each fill.  So, this carafe, spiller though it was, wouldn't deliver a full 12 cups, despite my filling it to the brim, and being rewarded, most times, with spillover (overfill as far as this one's water reservoir was concerned).For whatever it's worth, Amazon immediately refunded my purchase, for which I had already used up the credit to my 'wallet' by ordering the other version I'd considered when ordering this one.  It's the very similar-looking https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C2JK9Y8V - which I've used several times since my return of the subject unit, and found the resulting coffee grounds' level as expected, which is to say the dark line went only about halfway up the edge.  And furthermore, it delivers an honest 12 cups - 4 fills of my ancient mug, with only space enough left to put on the sipper, no-spill lid - every time.  And the water reservoir fill opening is massive by comparison.If you're considering the two, I'd definitely recommend the link immediately above, and give THIS one a pass."
"We bought this to replace our older model that we've enjoyed for years. I see it's still available here. The carafe of that one kept the coffee hot for hours and hours. Over time though, It developed the problem of the basket not draining fast enough or maybe the water was being pushed into it too quickly, leading to overflowing of coffee granules into the lid and into the cups. Also the interior seam of the pot failed at some point and we could hear old coffee liquid swirling around in there. Ick. So anyway we purchased this model. In general it works just fine, however the instructions to heat the pot before brewing concerned me that it wouldn't hold heat as well as the old pot. And it does not. 99.9% of the time we use the Brew later option so the coffee is ready when we get up in the morning. The water would be room temperature as would the pot. I could feel the heat radiating on the outside of the pot and lid, which immediately tells you it's not holding the heat, with the old carafe it would be cool on the outside and I would only be able to feel heat just around the rim a little bit. Within 2 hours the coffee has lost I estimate 60% of the warmth. I just poured my first cup and I had to microwave it for 30 seconds to heat it up. With the old pot after 2 hours it still would have been almost as hot as originally brewed and then only losing heat enough to need a micro warm up 3 to 4 hours later. It does brew a good cup of coffee and everything works fine but the thermal carafe is not very thermal at all."
"UPDATE May 20, 2024: Approaching 3-months and still no replacement lid as promised by the manufacturer (Spectrum Home Appliances). They tell me a new lid is backordered since March 5, 2024. with no ETA. I suggested they buy a coffee pot from Amazon, which they'd get in 2-days, and send me the lid since it is now conveniently passed the return window. Customer Service is a joke - sure they return emails but with no satisfaction and no making it right. They offered to send me a new coffee pot if I cut the cord and ship it to them. So, I have to do the work and drive to the post office and pay for shipping and who knows how long it would take to get a new coffee pot. If they have an entire unit in stock - take out the lid and send it! Or would they order it from Amazon and send me the lid if I send them the cord? I already sent pictures. They should just refund me at this point.Upon opening the packaging, the center part of the carafe lid (plunger and spring) was not secured and a clear rubber washer that secures the plunger to the lid was inside the bottom of the carafe. I attached the washer to the underside of the lid to secure the plunger but the washer seemed too loose. This ""plunger"" as I call it, is under the filter and pressed down while brewing - the coffee flows through it, into the carafe. It stays down while the carafe is in place to keep the coffee hot, I imagine. When you remove the carafe from the plate, the plunger lifts up slightly so you can pour the coffee.Upon removing the lid for cleaning after the 2nd pot of coffee, the plunger and spring popped out and the clear washer went down the drain. What a dumb design flaw. I asked the company for a replacement lid because I don't trust replacing just the washer. We'll see if they respond at all. I'm surprised Black & Decker sells something like this when I could have gone to the Dollar Store and purchased a perfectly functional drip coffee pot for a fraction of the price.Also, the clock does not have a backlight so if you want to know the time you need to be right in front of the machine. When the brewing starts, the clock disappears and it starts a countdown to when it will automatically shut-off. The carafe lid is difficult to turn to remove.I was switching from a percolator to a drip coffee pot and took my time researching a good drip coffee pot since I only purchase one once every dozen years. I trusted Black & Decker to have a superior product. The coffee tastes great but the machine has multiple flaws.If I don't get a swift response from Black & Decker about replacing the lid, I will return this item. Returning an item really irritates me - the customer - because I'd have to drive quite a distance to a UPS Store during store hours, which means I'd likely need to take time off of work or go there on my lunch break. I'm so disappointed.UPDATE: It has been about six weeks and I'm still waiting for a replacement lid from the manufacturer, who tells me it is backordered with no ETA. Every day I dislike this coffee pot more and more. Instead of returning it I decided to hold the lid pieces together while brewing and pouring and just wait for the new lid to arrive. That was a mistake.It takes about 21 minutes to brew 10-cups of coffee. Yes, you can set a timer so it brews automatically but then you can't pre-heat the carafe as recommended. It should be filled with very hot water before you brew to warm the carafe and keep the coffee hot. What a pain.When the coffee is brewed, the clock disappears and the timer starts (120 minutes) - that is the countdown for the machine to automatically shut off. It may as well shut off as soon as the coffee is brewed because the plate the carafe sits on does not heat up, so why are we counting? The coffee isn't as hot as the old percolator so even the first cup is ...meh hot. You can just as well take that carafe and sit it on a table. I've considered submerging the carafe in a pot of hot water to keep the coffee hot or brew smaller batches.Unless you have the time to soak the carafe in a steaming hot bath before brewing and then wait for the full brew to finish and you have enough people to drink it all before it loses any more heat, then by all means, by this machine. Just make sure you're careful not to loosen the rubber washer on the lid."
"I'll never buy a coffee pot made of glass because now that I know these thermal pots keep the coffee hot longer, I'll never switch back but this one just doesn't do that for as long. We had a different brand thermal coffee pot prior to this one, it was bigger, took up more space on the counter because it was a dual 12 cup and K cup, but was harder for me to put the water in when making the coffee due to severe arthritis and the way it was set up. It still worked but I was struggling so I wanted to find another that may be easier for me. But I loved love loved the way I could make coffee at 5 a.m. and then pour myself a refill at 11 and that coffee would still be hot. I mean hot!!I researched several, this had the best reviews and was very reasonably priced. It's definitely much easier to make the coffee, takes up less space but sure doesn't measure up to keeping the coffee hot. It's a little better than the glass pot but not a ton. It did cost close to half of what the other one cost but I would still expect the pot, itself, to keep the coffee hot. It really doesn't for very long. Today we made coffee at 7, had to heat it in the microwave for hot coffee by 11. That's a big difference.It's not a bad coffee maker by any means but if you're like me and drink it from early morning into early afternoon and want it to stay hot, this one isn't for you."
"This coffeemaker replaced our older pot due to the heating element quit working.We selected this pot because we liked the smaller size and especially the stainless thermo carafe.I was disappointed because front panel Is not lighted making it difficult to see what button to push. I have to use a flashlight to set the clock and delay start. This pot makes up to 12 cups, you can adjust how strong you like your coffee.Other than these issues the coffee maker works well the coffee is good and stays hot for about two hours.  Would I recommend this pot to a friend, yes,"
"I would like to have a reusable strainer instead of coffee filter which I thought it had. A plus is as soon as the coffee is done percolating it starts a count down to shut off.1 star on the digital display. The power button has an LED in it. Why doesn't the display? You have to bend over and look real close to see if Brew Later & Strong brew is on in low light conditions, the morning & evening. When your drinking it and fixing it."
"My high end coffee maker died and I decided to go with something less expensive and thinking the thermal one would be great. Unfortunately since I drink mine black, I kept having a metallic and maybe slightly bitter taste in my coffee. Maybe had I chosen one with glass I would have been happy with the flavor. However, my husband who uses sugar and creamer did not taste any difference.  Otherwise the product was great. Easy to set up and very easy to clean. Pretty fast brew. Fast shipping also. Wish I could have rated it higher, but the taste made all the difference. I have stored it away for now and went back and ordered a new one to replace the broken one."
"The pictures don’t accurately show the display and buttons are at an angle so the handle always covers the display. Also the display is small, not lighted and hard to read making set up difficult. Set up instructions are not well written. The button you press to pour is pretty far up on the handle and a little hard to use. The valve on the bottom of the brew basket is supposed to stop the flow when you pull the carafe out but it still lets enough coffee out that I need a paper towel to clean it up. It does its job, carafe keeps the coffee hot for a reasonable time. For reasons stated above I would not buy it again."
"I can now travel without complaining about the coffee, as this pot trained me to not care if my coffee was  too hot, too cold or over-extracted. A drip pot is just automated pour over. Why is it so difficult to make a pot that brews at a specific temperature over a short period of time? I've had good drip makers and bad drip makers, but this maker has been my second least favorite in my entire coffee drinking life."
"I so wanted to love this coffee maker. Pros: Easy to clean, easy to use. Clock is easy to set. Water reservoir is easy to fill. if you want it to brew strong you push one button. Basket and carafe are easy to remove and clean. Cons: coffee does not brew hot enough and the lid to the carafe is impossible to clean. There's a temperature readout on the unit and it routinely says 118 degrees. Coffee needs to brew at 195 or higher. Even using a Yeti cup the coffee is not hot enough when it leaves the carafe."
Pro:The brewer works well.The carafe keeps the coffee hot.10 cups brewed in about 11 minutesCon:No back lightAlmost impossible to see the PM on the clock.Power button stays on for two hours as if it was meant for a warming plate
This is a beautiful pot but I’m unhappy with the clock…it’s very small and does not light up. When u set the timer for the coffee it’s impossible to see if it’s set. There is only a light when u manually turn on the coffee maker.
"The small display is not backlit. It is vary hard to see the small print indicators, like whether the auto brew is turned.on or not. I will never buy another that doesn't have a backlit display"
I bought this coffee maker with carafe so that the coffee would stay warm. Dissapointed that the coffee cools off quickly as if it is not in a carafe. I would not purchase this again.
"I really wanted to like this, but it’s just meh. Nothing special, nothing great, nothing to write home about. Okay coffee quality, loud and the worst part is that the thermal carafe isn’t thermal at all. My microwave gets more use heating coffee than ever before. Glad I decided to keep an actual thermal carafe from my old coffee maker, so now I’m able to keep the coffee hot for hours instead of minutes."
"Just a few thoughts on this from a longtime daily user we've owned this thing for 3 years. It hasn't let us down in terms of working but not a fan of the carafe and looking to upgrade once this thing dies.. if it will.Positives:1) 3 years of ownership and almost daily use and it hasn't failed or had issues yet.2) The carafe keeps the coffee warm for 4 hours, as long as you don't mind your coffee warm. Don't expect piping hot coffee after a couple hours.3) It's very simple to use, setting the auto on/off and just general use, it's very simple and easy4) Makes good coffee - I don't know how it compares to others in a side-by-side test, but as someone that drinks black drip during the week, and espresso drinks on the weekend from any one of our 6 local shops, it does drip well and no complaints there.  It's also very easy to adjust the strength - not through the buttons, but with grind and water volume. It's nicely sensitive to adjustments while stays consistent over daily use.Negatives:1) The reviews saying how difficult it is to get the manufacturing oil cleaned in the beginning are spot on. I remember we cleaned thoroughly and had to run it 4-5 times with water+vinegar and wash after each time before the taste and smell of plastic and manufacturing oil was gone.2) The carafe spills coffee EVERYTIME I pour coffee in my cup. I'm so used to it, that I just automatically pour my coffee over a sink and have a paper towel on hand. I've tried so many different techniques and will always get dribble of coffee going down the front of the carafe or just spilling and missing my cup.3) the lid covering the basket doesn't have a tight seal - sometimes we have to slap the top so it seats down, and steam pours out the top so we have to keep the coffee machine out from under our cabinets - though that's probably not a unique fault to this price range of coffee makers."
"While the speed of brew is great, no matter how I get my coffee ground it backs up and I always get grounds in the pot when I make 10-12 cups. Also does not matter if I push strength button for strong brew. I literally have to pause every 4 cups for at least a minute to let reservoir go down."
If you have problems with hands and turning things the lid may be a problem.  I ordered this as a gift and showed up too late. When I received it it was missing the basket and the instructions.  I was not able to use it because no basket.  Thermos seems sturdy to keep things warm.
"My wife and I purchased this new black and decker coffee pot. At first we liked it but we both tried to figure out how to program it to come on in the morning. Never could figure it out, may need to go get a college course on how to get it to work. Way to complicated from our other black and decker coffee unit. Also, a very serious issue is that the 110 volt plug in cord is way to short to plug into the wall on the counter so you need to buy a small extension cord  for extra room to plug it in. But other than that the coffee pot is good. I like it how it makes 10 cup and the coffee basket is easy to get to."
"Overall it worked fine and easy to use.  12 cup capacity.  Not worth the amount I paid for it.  It is kind of loud, it scared our cat.The plastic part of carafe separated and it started leaking when pouring and it does cool off quickly."
"Started out thinking this was pretty good - made a decent cup of coffee, brewed quickly, easy to clean (i.e., daily washing), easy to program, no leaking. But then one morning, after about a month, I took a sip of coffee and found it undrinkable. I had to throw it out.Doing complete descaling with vinegar worked - but the coffeemaker is supposed to alert you when it needs descaling, which it failed to do. Also, the instructions claimed that it would need descaling after about 60 pots, but it actually needed it after 30 pots (one month = one pot a day in our family).It's bad enough that it has to be descaled so frequently. But it is unacceptable to wake up one busy morning and find that my coffee has to be thrown out with no time to make or buy another cup. If at least the coffeemaker had alerted me as it was supposed to, I could have taken preemptive action. So I will look for another coffeemaker, although sadly I don't trust either customer or expert reviews. (This one got very good reviews.)"
"I purchased this coffee maker a few months back and wanted to wait to review it until I had used it for a while to give it a solid, credible review.I had one of the previous versions of this coffee maker which lasted me many years! (Actually so many, that I'm embarrassed to say how long. And although it still made perfectly good coffee, the appliance itself is looking very sad and worn. Shame on me for making a judgment call, based on appearance, to replace it!)The carafe from the previous coffee maker was a war horse and kept my coffee warm for several hours. Forward to the new coffee maker. Much has changed and mostly not for the better.This Black and Decker 12 cup carafe coffee maker seems a lot more flimsy than the first. I followed the instructions to run water through the machine several times before I used it. (Note: you will need a paper filter or a reusable metal filter for this machine - it does not come with one.) Although I followed the instructions, there was a strong plastic flavor when I made my first pots of coffee. I actually spilled them out and considered never using it again.  The brewer sat useless in my kitchen for several weeks, so I decided to give it one last go and the plastic flavor seems to have dissipated.Unfortunately, the carafe does not retain heat like the old one. In fact, I may start using my old carafe (if it fits) which I had intended to donate to a charity.The coffee maker is easy to use. It has a digital clock display and an automatic timer so you can set your coffee pot to make coffee ahead of time. However, I don't recommend setting it too many hours ahead of time! The coffee will be cold by then.Also, I swear I saw in the details online, before I ordered, that it came with a long retractable cord. It does not. Please consult the manufacturer's specifications prior to ordering.Honestly, I wish I had a five-star review. Alas I do not. Overall, I would give this coffee maker three-stars. I wish appliances were still manufactured with make good quality and durability in mind. Items that last for a long time. Sadly, our society has been brainwashed to think we need to replace things when styles change. Ah capitalism! This is what is killing our planet and our climate. All these disposable items. I will certainly take all these things into consideration when I make my next purchase - which is hopefully a very long time from now."
Need magnifying glass to set timer
"This coffee maker is not bad, but I'd give it an average rating at best.  There are a few flaws.  When you brew your coffee, a blue light comes on.  It goes off when it's finished brewing.  However, when we pull the coffee pot when we see the blue light has shut off, it drips.  Therefore, we've determine blue light goes out too early, BEFORE it's done.  Even after waiting a bit, it still drips.Also, it's been known to act strangely.  We put all the water in the back, made the coffee as we always do, yet only a small portion gets into the pot.  It's like it just stops brewing.It comes with a top that is removable, which is great.  Everything is removable making it easy to clean.  However, the top can be a bit finicky.  You're supposed to press down on the lever in the back to pour, and it sometimes comes out full force but mostly it's a small trickle, or barely at all.  I'd suggest taking the top off altogether before pouring."
"There’s no heating base, because the pot is insulated stainless steel. Therefore, the coffee gets warm very fast. I decided to send it back, and buy a different one."
"Our old coffee maker bit the dust. Sad as it was, I'm always a bit excited to buy a new one. I really liked our old one, coffee was great, timer, able to adjust heat, able to make down to one cup. But there were a few things I wasn't so wild about, too. The basket was a bit awkward to use, the finish peeled a bit. Etc. So I decided to try something different, that might use a bit less energy overall.I opted for this thermal unit, thinking that it would keep the coffee well hot enough during our normal 2-3 hour window of sipping coffee most days. Sadly, it doesn't. As the coffee volume decreases in the pot, there is less to keep it all warm enough. So the last couple cups often need to be nuked in the microwave to get it back to a palatable temp. (Additional energy used.)Also, when you make a fresh pot, if there is some left-overs from the last one (like we sometimes do), since there is no hot plate it doesn't reheat the remaining liquid very well. So now you start out with lukewarm coffee. So... (Additional energy used.)Finally, if you want to come in from the cold and have a cup of joe, it is typically stone cold. The thermos pot actually cools the coffee below room temperature, to about 65 degrees. So...(Additional energy used!)I do have an individual hot plate, and I did keep my old carafe, so I can put the coffee in that and keep warm on the hot plate. But now I've got TWO pots involved, for cleaning, etc. And of course, the hot plate doesn't run itself, so it better be plugged in! (Additional + energy used!!)So my primary objective of replacement was met, we do have a coffee maker. But the primary purpose for going this route was to save energy. (Every bit saved is OUR money saved!) So that goal was absolutely an epic fail.This unit does have some benefits. If we have company and make a fresh pot, I can now take the pot directly over to where we're socializing for ready refills and warm-ups. That's nice, because of where it is in our kitchen and the interrupting walk from all seating areas. But those are not every day occasions, so here's what I'm going to do.This coffee maker does make decent coffee. So I think that for now I'm going to shop for a different one. I don't have to rush, so I can look for the right unit (hello RESEARCH) at the right price. That will hopefully become our go-to regular unit.  This unit is not as large as post, so I will clean and dry it out, and keep it for occasional use, or possibly it can even go to fishing tourney's with my husband. Since there is nothing to break, it is reasonable to keep for occasional and creative uses!Would I recommend? Yes, with conditions."
"I purchased this item in November of 2023 on Amazon--10 months ago.  Last week, the clean cycle told me it was time to clean the pot.  I followed directions as I have in the past, but the clean cycle refused to shut off.  After 6!! tries, the clean cycle still would not shut off.  I finally gave up on the whole thing, and have purchased a new Mr. Coffee!  The Black and Decker did make pretty good coffee--when it worked, although when making a full pot, the grounds tended to overflow."
"I like B&D coffee makers, have owned many across the years, all solid performers, so when it was time to  upgrade it's the only brand I considered. I was specifically seeking a thermal pot coffee maker, to keep coffee hot for a time, as I'm retiring soon and anticipate lazy days enjoying a pot of coffee at my leisure.This is not the pot for that, primarily because it just does NOT keep the coffee hot for very long at all. For an hour? Something close to hot. More than an hour? Luke warm. Longer than 2? Forget about it.Because the maker had no hot plate, leaving it on the plate or taking it off makes zero difference. It's supposed to NOT depend on a hot plate, instead letting the thermal carafe do its thing, but this is a thin-skinned carafe simply incapable of storing heat. I've tried every possible combination, including the advised ""pre heating"" the carafe, nothing made any difference in the above mentioned time limits at all.The pity is, it makes a great cup of coffee, especially on the strong setting. Excellent coffee. But the reason I bought this model was for the carafe, to keep coffee warm long enough for me to return for another cup, and it still be hot. Nope. Would be better off with any standard coffee maker with a decent warming plate for that.A real disappointment in that measure. I'd return it but I already trashed my old model before I discovered this isn't up to snuff."
"11/18/2023The machine is now working as it should. Must learn to read ALL the instructions prior to use. However, still have issue about no starter filters being supplied, the LED screen does not light up. Makes reading the display difficult at best, impossible at night even with kitchen lights on. Only the On/Off button lights up.All other functions appear to work. Without preheating the thermal carafe it kept coffee warm for almost 2 hrs. Hope this clarifies and helps.Was so very much looking forward to my 1st cup of home brew on what I considered a good brand based on their lawn equipment.As soon as I unpacked it I turned coffee maker on to set clock and check functions when realized, unfortunately, LED panel does not light up. Only the on/off button does. However, in just turning the machine on and only after setting the clock, the sides of the thin, lightweight plastic housing was already quite hot to the touch. Not a good omen.As of yet have not made any coffee so can not yet attest to those functions. Did not realize no starter filters included. And anyway since the instructions recommend adding hot water to the thermos prior to making the coffee to help keep it warm once brewed that pretty much overrides the value of the programming function for morning ready coffee that will not be as hot since the maker does not have a warming plate.Seriously, I have been a fan of B & D’s lawn equipment line for many years. Used it in my landscaping business for several years. My current thinking is perhaps they either need to majorly improve these coffee making products or go back and concentrate on what they already have been successful with.I wish them all the best however, I will be requesting a refund.BTW the 1 star is for on time delivery and presentation though inaccurate/incomplete information."
The canister does stay cool to the touch but the upper thermal area gets hot and the very top of the machine gets very very hot!
"It's really light weight to the point that you can knock it over with no effort, no kidding it might weigh less than a spoon without the carafe.  THe carafe has a whole lot going for it, pours perfectly, and keeps the coffee hot for a long time.  I like the simplicity.  You put your coffee in, your water in, set the carafe, push go.  You don't have to sign into an app and give away your pii to drink a coffee or anything like that.  Should have come with 1-7 filters to get you started, that's a big miss.  Cord should be longer than it is, it's less than a foot long from what I can tell.  The coffee it made is actually pretty great. For the price, I'm giving it barely 3 stars.  At this price it should obviously have a reusable coffee filter in the box, or some starter paper filters at least..."
"I love everything about this, except the design of the spout on the pot. Its a lever you press to let the coffee flow out but it is not leak proof. I really love the auto-shut off option since my elderly, and often forgetful, parents live with me. If it were not for the leaky pot i wouldve kept this but it leaves quite a big mess every morning"
The coffee maker is beautiful. Unfortunately the carafe doesn't keep the coffee hot which is very disappointing. I wouldn’t recommend it.
Don't like the cover on the pot. Doesn't open to pour well without it coming completely off.
"The reusable filter/basket was missing and no instructions were included. The coffee maker was dirty and had to be thoroughly cleaned out. While the machine appears to work, I was very disappointed in the condition in which I received it! I would NOT buy this again!!!"
It does make fine coffee. The one we replaced turned off automatically.
"This Black & Decker coffee machine looks very nice, but the pot doesn't stay as hot as it should because there is no heating element on the bottom (which I did read). I need to microwave my coffee for the second cup. It is durable."
"We purchased this coffeemaker in September of ‘23 and it quit today July 25, 2024.While it worked : Coffee is of good, consistent quality. Carafe keeps coffee warm for many hours. There is a regular and a strong brew function. The strong brew takes forever to brew, so if you just want a quick cuppa make sure your setting isn’t on strong. There is no auto shut off. Also no sound alert that the brewing cycle is complete. Given that the machine didn’t even make it one year being asked to make coffee only twice a day, this was a disappointing purchase.Edited 8/8/24. I received the free replacement from Black and Decker yesterday. Only paid $7.50 shipping and handling. No fuss, friendly service. THANK YOU."
"BLACK+DECKER CM2045B-1 12-Cup Coffee MakerI will start by saying this is the most amazing coffee pot I have ever had. I really loved that my coffee stays hot for hours and there was no burned coffee. I could carry my pot of freshly brewed coffee with me all over the house when I am cleaning or working outside.The reason I am giving it 2 stars is because there are two parts that connect and allow the coffee to flow from the coffee basket into the pot. BOTH PARTS are broken, and the springs are exposed. I called to purchase replacement parts. I was told there were no replacement parts and that I could have a replacement model, but that it would NOT be the exact same model. I would need to mail a check for the shipping and a new unit would be sent to me. I would also need to cut the cord of the old model and send them pictures this.Um. What? I am not doing this. Instead, I am going to find a different brand that carries replacement parts."
"I love the size, the ease of operation, the small footprint...EVERYTHING - except for the nasty plastic/off-gassing taste that refuses to dissipate and infuses every single pot of coffee as it brews!I purchased this about six weeks ago (October 5) and have run countless cycles through the machine. The taste is still disgusting and the coffee undrinkable! I have had a variety of drip coffee makers made by different companies through the years and have never experienced anything like this before.I have tried MULTIPLE cycles of: plain water, water and vinegar mix; water, vinegar and baking soda mix; water and lemon juice mix. I read online that there may be a filmy residue left after manufacturing so it was necessary to physically wipe it down to remove it.  I have wiped down all exposed internal plastic parts of the machine with alcohol. And lemon juice. I even tried vodka! The taste is still disgusting and the coffee undrinkable!The only thing that helps a bit is to take the machine apart after using, removing the carafe lid, separating the basket filter from its holder and leaving the lid open overnight to air out...which totally makes having a programmable coffee maker a waste of time and money! This does help, however, and the coffee is quite drinkable.I read that recently manufactured items may have not had enough time to off-gas so this may not have been on the shelf long... This doesn't help my current issue but I will keep this in mind, in future, when purchasing similar items.I'm am absolutely at my wits end! I love everything else about this lovely coffee maker and have until the end of January to return it. I am loathe to return it knowing the environmental cost and the ultimate destination of Amazon returned goods but I also hate to take the financial hit of an item I will take to the electronic disposable center as it is unusable and a  waste of counterspace.I would absolutely consider buying it again in a heartbeat, however, in the hope that this was a one-off and I would have better luck next time.UPDATE: Almost three months after receiving the coffee maker, It STILL smells and tastes of plastic/off-gassing. The carafe is now frequently filled with coffee grounds.  Don't just me on my preference for weak coffee but I only use two tablespoons of coffee per pot so cannot understand how there are even any grounds left to end up in the carafe!I contacted Black and Decker costumer service thru the Amazon link, asking their opinion and listing all of my attempts to remove the smell/taste.  This was the same list I included in my review above.  They immediately responded with a macro to let me know they have a different division for small appliances and copied that division on the message.The response from homeappliancesupport@spectrumbrands.com was to, one again, provide them with all of the order information as well as the plug number from the electrical cord. Not sure what any of that has to do with questions regarding ingesting plastic from the coffee maker so I am beyond annoyed at this point as all of the info (with the exception of the plug number) was in the Amazon order info I forward to them.  Regardless, I sent the requested information.  This is all in one thread, mind you, including the original complaint.I just received a response to my last submission asking if I have descaled with vinegar and water. Okay, I'm done! No more chances to make this right. I changed my rating to one star based on a faulty product and none-existent costumer service, am returning the coffee maker today and never buying Black and Decker product again."
I like the style. Since it’s thermal I thought coffee would be hotter than it gets. It doesn’t keep it as hot as I like it but that could be a personal thing. I’ll keep it. It looks nice on my counter.
Made great coffee for 7 months and stopped working
"The unit works great.But, there is a significant deficiency in the digital readout in that it is not backlit. We love our coffee strong.  In the morning, it is difficult to see if the “strong” setting has been selected or not. That’s very disappointing. The last thing that I want in the morning is to have to use a flashlight to see if the word “strong” is displayed or not.When this one wears out, I’ll pay close attention to this in the future."
"It's pretty basic. Says it makes 12 cups, but 12 cups worth of grounds do not fit in the basket. The water spout is not at the right height to allow enough room for grounds.You'll still need paper filters because the basket allows a lot of grounds to get through.It's impossible to read the am/pm on the clock; it's just too small.Other than these issues, it makes coffee and has a delay feature. Also cleaning which I haven't used.Not enough issues to return it, but just barely."
"Bought as a Christmas gift, didn't work right out of the box. BIG disappointment.UPDATE 1/1/15: Amazon came through as usual and cross shipped us a new unit at no charge since I immediately shipped the defective one back. Thanks Amazon!!! :-)I am now essentially convinced that the original unit was a return. The new one has far more packaging than the original. The plastic bag around the entire unit on the inside was tied in a knot on this one and there were cardboard shipping spacers all over the place, on top of the carafe and under it, unlike the original unit.This is a Christmas gift to my girlfriend and we were both disappointed at the original being defective. However, she REALLY likes the look and features of this unit and wanted a replacement. The unit would power up and the lights came on but it wouldn't brew a pot of plain water to rinse it out. This one we fired up with only water in and it started brewing almost immediately, but we had to listen closely because it's so quiet! This one generates far less noise than the old B&D unit it replaced. I can't speak to other's experiences but the coffee is hot, just a little too hot to drink immediately, perfect, IMO. I almost scalded myself testing the temp of the plain water last night. I woke up fully 2.5 hours after my girl made coffee this morning and it was still amazingly hot, and this is all relying on the thermal carafe, there is no hot pad on the unit. The thermal pot is excellent, apparently keeps the coffee hot for a very long time. The flavor of the coffee is noticeably better than the old B&D unit it replaced, no bitter, scorched flavor from sitting on a hot pad.The product descriptions here are written by Amazon personnel based on the manufacturer's information and their own perceptions. They are often not the information as written by the manufacturers themselves so I always review the manufacturer's website for accurate data on the product. While the unit could definitely benefit from a backlit display I did not expect it to have one since the B&D website made no mention of it. The display itself is relatively high contrast, however,  but still requires the use of glasses for programming.I don't have much data on Black And Decker appliances. Their power tools are for light household use only which is why I only buy tools from their DeWalt division (yes, they're the same company). My girlfriend is a huge fan, however, and says she's had bad experiences with Mr. Coffee, whereas I haven't. She specifically wanted a B&D coffee maker so this is what she got.So far so good and considering Amazon's excellent response I increased the rating to three stars. Even if the original wasn't a return (I'm convinced it was) modern mass manufacturing is going to generate a defective unit once in a while, so I can't hold it against Black And Decker. I'll increase the rating even further later once we've gotten several trouble-free months of use out of the unit. Stay tuned.....Thanks Amazon and Black And Decker."
"Had been looking to replace our Cuisenart coffee maker (burnt out twice in 4 months time) and just wanted something that would last a bit longer so we could get our daily ""coffee fix."" Found a lot of reviews for this Black and Decker — as the pick for ""budget"" models. Coffee maker is well made; good size (doesn't take up a lot of counter space); and easy to operate. Would be a great pick if it wasn't foe one thing - coffee doesn't stay warm for very long in the carafe. The Cuisenart was hot in the steel carafe all day  long and we are very disappointed that this is not the case here. It might if B&D had included a pretty simple and common sense item — an actual warming plate.While the plate this coffee maker comes with is metallic-ish, it does not have any sort of heating element too keep the coffee in the pot hot. Since the carafe is somewhat like a thermos (manual says to actually keep coffee hot, fill it with hot water for some odd sum minutes before brewing) it needs some type of warming plate to heat the metals and air in the carafe to keep it hot for any length of time. As is, coffee is lukewarm after about an hour after being brewed. If wasn't for this annoying issue, it would have been a steaming hot five stars."
"I bought this to replace my current coffeemaker which is not doing well. This is a very nice looking pot, but it will not work on my coffee cabinet. The lid on this machine needs to be fully raised in order to pour water into the reservoir. I did the preliminary cleaning of the new machine, and as per instructions, brewed 2 pots of just water thru to flush out the lines on the new unit. It took 24 minutes to brew one pot (12 cups) of water. I decided to try pouring from the carafe, and it leaked all over the front of the lid. I can't see this making it long in my home. I am returning this machine and will try another brand."
"This thing leaks and drips like an old man at a urinal.  It drips when you pour it.  And the steal-a-cup feature isn't a leak-free experience either.  The LCD screen is ridiculously small and difficult to read if you're looking to see if the Strong function is set or not.  The carafe is cumbersome and poorly designed.  It will keep coffee hot for a while but to maximize that amount of time you need to rinse it with hot water first.  That's all fine in theory but in the morning, I have to wait a while for my tap water to get hot enough so I often forgoe this step.  All in all, I give this a solid 3 stars.  I'm putting it in my camping kit because it's not capable enough for the kitchen."
My main problem with this coffee maker is that it drips when you pull the carafe out and you have to wipe it up before putting the carafe back.  The thermos carafe also cools down after a while especially when you have less coffee in it so we end up having to microwave our coffee cups from time to time even when I heat the carafe with hot water which seams like a waist of water for not a huge result. The handle is kind of thick and need two hands to press the button and pour.  I also think it’s a bummer that it doesn’t come with a filter.  Thank god we had one from our old maker.  I do like the design and fits perfectly in the space we have for it.
I have been pleased with how this coffee maker prepares coffee.  The problem with this unit is it will not complete a cleaning cycle.  I fill the unit with the vinegar/water mix and hold the brew button for 5 seconds.  The unit scrolls clean across the time panel for about two cups of the reservoir then turns off the cleaning cycle the display returns to the time of day.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            First off, out of the box the tab that you use to lift the lid every time you want to make coffee, or fill it with water was broken, and we had to send for a replacement unit. Also, the cord is too short, not even two feet long, so we were very limited on where we could put it on our counters with out using an extension cord. I would gladly pay .50 cents more for a three or four foot cord.Other than that, it makes good coffee, and we like the 12 cup capacity compared to our old 10 cup model. I am not sold on the “thermal” carafe yet. My wife likes it because it doesn’t scorch the pot, or coffee, if you let the carafe get too low while the burner is still hot, but that’s what the “auto shut off” feature is for I thought.Another thing, and I have not seen ANY coffeemaker that has this, but a battery to maintain the clock and program settings when the power flashes on and off would be very nice, and I am sure those little battery circuits are available pretty cheap. In the midwest we have power flashes all the time in Spring, Summer and Fall, and having to reset every appliance in the house every time the power flashes becomes a tedious pain in the buttocks. We"
I returned the item only because a lot of steam comes out of the top and it was forming condensation under my wall cabinet
"I purchased this to save electric, because the on and off heat plate of traditional coffee makers wastes a lot of energy. But we almost gave up on this one after the first few days, with coffee spilling all over the counter the first times we brewed coffee. There is a seal in the lid of the carafe that must be firmly pushed down by the basket above for the coffee to go into the carafe. If it is not perfectly placed, and the lid on the water reservoir firmly snapped shut, the coffee will spill all around the carafe instead of going in. We started making coffee in the sink because we couldn't figure out what was happening.What is amazing is that the manual says nothing of this risk, nor includes it in their troubleshooting section. I believe three factors contributed to the overflows:1) The lid may not have been firmly snapped closed on the water reservoir. This meant that the basket was not pushing hard enough on the valve on the carafe lid - causing it to remain closed. Coffee then spills over the top of the carafe.2) Since I assume that I would have snapped the lid closed, I can't be sure that #1 caused the spill overs. I suspect the seal on the carafe lid was too stiff (being brand new) and that the seal wasn't fully open despite the correct setup, causing the coffee to spill over the lid rather than entering it.3) if the carafe is not precisely in place under the basket, it may be possible for the valve in the lid to not be triggered, causing the coffee to spill over the lid rather than entering it.If you get this coffee maker and carefully ensure that #1 and #3 are correct, I still can't promise that you won't have the overflow issue until you break the seal in after a few accidents. Since you won't read anything about this in the manual, if you have this coffee maker, you now know how to avoid spills. However, if you didn't buy it yet, I'd recommend you spend a bit more for another thermos carafe coffee maker that doesn't have this potentially fatal flaw."
"We got this for the insulated carafe and that does keep the coffee warm without cooking it on a burner. But there are flaws that we have had to learn to work around:-The backlight for the display broke after a couple weeks-It’s difficult to fill the reservoir by pouring from the carafe: the carafe has no way to measure cups, the reservoir level is difficult to read, and the opening for the water is narrow making it easy to miss and spill.-While pouring coffee, if you tilt the carafe too far, the hollow lid will fill up and then even when you let go of the lid lever, coffee will dribble out and spill.-The lid of the carafe is hollow and holds water after washing so you might get dirty water in your coffee. Yuck.-not really a design flaw but you can’t see how much coffee is left in the carafe because it’s opaque metal."
Unfortunately the carafe lid only allows a small trickle if liquid to pour. Super annoying.
"18 minute Brew time  - mehNo back light on the clock - BOOIf you fill the therm carafe to full (below the plastic) it will overflow through the over fill holes in the resevior.  - BIG BOONo grippy feet in the fron slides all around the counter - Big BOO. hard plastic knubs? really ???If mediocre had a picture it would be this coffee maker. yes it works, has a timer and brews coffee. the carafe keeps warm for a for a few hours, probably longer if prewarm the carafe but that is moot when setting a timer for the next morning. Despite being the same size carafe as my previous KRUPS i somehow get half a cup less of coffee.  Only gave it a try because my KRUPS dies after 2 years like clockwork and is annoying. at have the price i figure give this a shot. it keeps it warm for half as long so you get what you pay for. my model didnt come with reusable basket and the basket filters are kind of a pain because basket handle gets in the way.Will I keep it yes. and if you just want a thermal carafe without breaking the bank its good enough. just dont expect perfection"
"I am very disappointed in this coffee maker.  I wanted so badly to love it but the thermal pot doesn't keep the coffee hot very long at all, nit even 1 hour, and because there is no heating element in the bottom once it is brewed it starts cooling down fast.  I'm very surprised by how fast it turns to warm coffee in the thermus.  I was excited to have a large new coffee maker so my husband and I could enjoy our morning coffee but I end up microwaving my cup more times than not.  In today's day when thermal cups keep your coffee hot all day there is no reason this pot isn't made to do the same.  Needs improvement.  Otherwise I'd be happy wirh it."
"The price is right and the coffee is brewed just fine.The pot regularly leaks out the front and dribbles a bit to the point where we just pour over the sink.  Definitely not ideal.The area to pour the water into the reservoir is somewhat small and not removable, so pouring water in isn't great either.The stainless steel carafe doesn't hold heat for very long even if you fully rinse with hot tap like the instructions state.  There's no heating plate to retain any heat, either."
It’s actually kind of disappointing. All plastic except thermal pot. Plus I had to order a $10 reusable filter!! But I’ll try it. Easier than sending back & paying lots more for hopefully better quality
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            9-13-22 A week ago, I contacted B and D to complain about this sorry coffee maker.  The response was good enough (read on) but I had to send of the model and the cord plug which has the serial number.  Fair enough.  I sent the video and pictures that I posted below.  They will replace the unit B....U....T only if I send them the clipped cord or PDF of the picture.  I cut it and sent the pictures in.  The response is that they will escalate up the chain to get an approval and send a new one but it will take 7-14 days for my replacement to arrive.  7-14 days without a coffee maker!!  Coffee maker is an everyday use appliance so I had to buy an interim coffee maker to get me by until it arrives.  I had other makers send me the coffee maker before I send them the proof of destruction.  At this way, I can make coffee until replacement arrives and if needed send the proof of destruction.  Needless to say, I am not happy with Black and Decker.9-12-22 Added some pictures of dripping and how it pours out of spout compared to the marketing photo.  Someone really did a great job doctoring that photo.  Actual is much worse.  This was like this from day one.  When in doubt return it!!Original Review  First time I used it it leaked but manageable, still annoying.  The thing bothered me the most was that the when I poured coffee into my mug it was spilling over the side of the spout and making a mess on the counter.  I absolutely could not fill my thermos without make a serious mess on the countertop.  Thermos mouth are smaller than a mug but still much wider than the carafe spout.  Also in order to get the last cup of coffee left in the carafe, I had to hold the carafe almost upside down because there is a big internal step inside.  I put up with it saying if I send it back the company will just toss it.After a while we had to have a towel under the cup or pour over the sink.  Just when I decided I had enough of this nonsense, I was going to return it, Amazon said it was 1 day past the return date.  Ok so I put up with it and coffee leaking got worse.  For last few weeks, the coffee must be leaking from the plastic rim to Stainless Steel body joint area because now there is a serious drip 6 inches from the mug because the coffee travels down the carafe to the bottom.** I WILL NOW FOLLOW A STRICT RULE  - IF YOU ARE NOT HAPPY AS SOON AS YOU GET IT, SEND IT BACK ASAP!  DO NOT PROCRASTINATE AND END UP THROWING IT AWAY.  **"
"Great lookingKeeps coffee hotOnly 1 problem, there’s no markings on the outside or inside of the carafe to see how much water to use. The markings are on the water tunnel only."
I like my coffee hot. I pour a cup right after it's brewed. I have yet to get a cup of HOT coffee. Within moments it cools almost tepid then cold.
"The coffee maker for the most part performs as expected. It makes good hot coffee, and the thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot for quite some time. Unfortunately, I discovered that you can't turn your back on the coffee maker. In the month that I've owned it, for some unexplained reason, it has dumped a pot of hot coffee all over my counter and floor.Secondly, if you want to brew stronger coffee, the ""Strong"" brew button doesn't light up confirming that you actually engaged the feature. You have no way of knowing whether you're brewing stronger coffee or not. It may be that my unit is defective, but I have no way of knowing as I've never owned this product before.Would I own another? Probably, but only if I couldn't find a more reliable unit with a thermal carafe."
Like:  easy to program .  Stainless steel carafe.  The carafe holds liquid warm/hot for around two hours(depending if the carafe is pre-warmed with hot water).  Carafe is mobile to carry to work area etc.  Dislikes:  Carafe is very heavy and difficult to pour while holding spout open.Not easy to clean the inside.  Lip at the top holds back liquid (must turn upside down to empty).  Dislike the carafe.  Basket drips when carafe is removed.
"I like that it doesn’t sit and scorch your coffee by having it sit on a burner. It does help to pre-warm the pot so the metal doesn’t heat sink all the warmth out of your coffee.But really, humankind has been pouring water out of containers for literally thousands of years. That a company with the resources of Black & Decker can’t make a pour spout on a passive device like a carafe is the proper use of the word “sad”. Bring your manufacturing back home and quit buying foreign made junk B&D."
"We've actually now tried 5 of these! First one we purchased in 2019 and makes flawless coffee. We liked it so much that we bought a second one almost a year later to leave in the RV. This one overflows the filter and grounds get into the carafe. Assuming that this was just a bad unit we bought another one from Amazon. Same thing - grounds in the coffee. Sent this one back to Amazon and decided to try replacement under warranty from Black & Decker for the previous one. Customer service was great - sent us a replacement. Same result - grounds in coffee. Customer service was again great - sent us another one. Just made our first pot today - grounds in the coffee.Comparing the most recent coffee maker with the first one there have obviously been some minor design changes. The fins at the bottom of the basket are taller and the bottom of the resevoir looks different in the most recent version from the original. Their is no doubt in my mind that water flows too fast into the basket and overflows the filter. We've asked customer service to pass a long our issues to the design team but obviously that hasn't happened.Maybe some of you reading this review can come up with some suggestions as to how to make this most recent one work as we are done playing ping pong with Black Decker customer service. We use high quality Melitta 8-12 cup brown paper filters and pre-ground Folgers coffee and fill to the 12 cup mark. This combination works great in the 2019 version but not in the 2021 version. Water comes in too fast and goes above the filter and over the basket itself where the handle and notch are.9/7/21 UPDATE:After going through hundreds of reviews on this coffee maker, I found a response from B&D that suggested that softened water might be to blame for the overflowing grounds. We live in an area that has extremely hard water and have softened water. So we used both bottled water and water from our outdoor water spigots (not softened water) in the FIFTH unit we've received. Amazingly NO GROUNDS OVERFLOWED INTO THE COFFEE. The softened water causes the water and grounds to foam and push grounds over the edger of the filter.I'm upping our review to two stars. Why not higher? Because in the 27 years we have lived with softened water, this is the first coffee maker that has had this problem. Also, the first of the five units we received does not overflow with grounds. Soooo, we are keeping that first unit in our house and the last unit is going into our RV where we typically will not used softened water."
"I bought this Black & Decker Coffee Pot because I liked the idea of a thermal pot.  I purchased filters and MaxwellHouse Breakfast Blend Coffee as well.  The first time I used it the grounds were sitting in water as shown.  What did I do wrong?  I followed directions exactly.  I tried again.  No.  It did the same thing.  See photo.  I even posted a question to other buyers.  This is not normal.  It makes a huge mess.  Not only are wet coffee grounds everywhere in the sink when you try and pull this out, it spills onto the counter.  I was looking forward to a fresh cup of coffee.  Not this.  It’s being returned.  I’ll go back to a simple coffee pot that brews in a regular pot.  I’m not sure why this happens.  It has a “shower” feature.  Maybe that’s the issue?  Also, there’s no way to see how much water is in the carafe until you pour it in the machine.  The only guide is on the side of the machine.  Leaving you to guess until the water is in on how much coffee to actually use.  Poor design."
"Purchased as a gift for my 92 yo father. Cofee doesn’t get very hot and then carafe doesn’t keep it even that warm. Delay brew only made it worse. If you want it to keep the coffee hot, you have to pre-warm the thermal caraffe before making coffee. Umm, that’s the point of having a thermal carafe. Make the coffee in the early morning then keep it hot for a few hours. Didn’t happen. Very disappointing. Returned it."
"Unfortunately, I bought this coffee maker but did not need to use it for a while, so too late to return. Even with warming the carafe, the coffee starts out barely hot and just gets cooler from there. I had a Cuisinart with a thermal carafe that I absolutely loved, it kept the coffee hot for hours. I cannot wait to replace this coffee maker, but I won't be replacing it with a Black + Decker."
Makes coffee but sometimes coffee grounds in coffee and leaks when you pull pot out to pour. Made cheap!!!
BUT the metal thermos carafe does not keep the coffee hot for very long at all. The machine does not have a hot plate because it has the thermal pot. The bun on area on the machine does not light up so you need a flashlight to set it. The upside is that it does make a decent cup of coffee.
"I have had this same pot before and the clock/timer buttons stopped working so I ordered this to replace it. So I know it is a good coffee maker and the coffee maker itself not the issue I had with this purchase. But I accidentally ordered a ""like-new"" item. I thought I had just looked at that option and ordered it new and was surprised when I got it and the box had been poorly re-taped shut. But I checked my order and it said 'like-new' so I thought, my mistake, and that would be fine then as it said only minor cosmetic scratch/scuff. But when I took it out of the box, it had no packing inside (was loose in manufacturer box) and was all Dirty, had not even been cleaned and it had major scuffs. NOT ACCEPTABLE. It is going back.  Whoever processed this item and decided it as Like New needs a different job."
"UPDATE 6-12-23The dribbling while pouring the coffee from the carafe has gotten to the point that my wife and I can't stand it. The carafe was convenient to carry out to the living room to have it there for refills. It made such a mess of the living room table that it was worthless. We've purchased a new coffee maker, the Ninja Hot and Cold coffee maker and we love it so far. I'll be changing the rating to a 2 star. It made good coffee but the carafe needs some re-engineering.https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-Auto-iQ-Frother-Baskets-CP301/dp/B07FDFP6MY/ref=sr_1_4?hvadid=558708992773&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=2840&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=8155937655466394642&hvtargid=kwd-892727347821&hydadcr=4915_10080970&keywords=ninja+301+coffee+maker&qid=1686663507&sr=8-4In reviewing the Black and Decker 12 cup carafe coffee maker, I find that this particular model boasts an insulated stainless steel carafe, which sets it apart from many other coffee makers on the market. Additionally, it offers a digital clock display and an automatic timer, making it a convenient option for those who wish to pre-program their morning brew.However, there are a few drawbacks that must be considered. The carafe, although insulated, tends to drip and dribble when pouring. This issue caused a considerable mess and proved to be a significant inconvenience. Furthermore, the carafe does not retain heat as well as its glass counterparts, which can result in lukewarm coffee after a relatively short period. After filling the reservoir with cold water, I have to fill it with hot water from the sink and let it set a minute before beginning the brew. With this step the carafe keeps the coffee hot for a couple hours.Regarding the taste of the coffee itself, this Black and Decker model is average, neither exceptional nor poor. Its flavor is satisfactory, although it does not compare to the quality of coffee that can be achieved with a specialty coffee press or pour-over method.  The first couple pots did have a bit of an off flavor even though I followed directions and ran a few cycles with water beforehand.In conclusion, the Black and Decker 12 cup carafe coffee maker is a decent option for those seeking an insulated stainless steel carafe and automatic timer. However, the carafe's propensity to drip and the inability to retain heat may deter potential buyers. The coffee's average taste and drips are making me think that I need to return this one and find a better one."
"I purchased this coffee maker for 3 main reasons: the thermal carafe, the Vortex hot water brew technology, and the stop-and-pour function of the brewing basket.I have owned it and used it daily for barely 2 months.The thermal carafe, with all its bells and whistles, is not better than older models as far as keeping coffee warm for a period of time. The pouring mechanism in the lid really does reduce spills as promised, but is overly complicated, and pours so SLOW that I just remove the whole lid to pour. Also a pain to clean.The Vortex thingy is okay, and while it is an improvement over typical drip coffee makers' water delivery, only minimally.The pause-and-pour function of the brew basket is a miserable disaster.The silicon washer inside the basket at the bottom which keeps the exit hole sealed is FAR TOO SMALL IN DIAMETER, and continually pops out through the bottom of the hole very very easily, and comes off the stem at the same time, which allows the entire assembly with the spring and stem to fall out/come apart too.It ultimately got lost during rinsing/washing (probably down the drain; maybe when dumping the coffee grounds, I'm not sure... whichever, after several mishaps finally one day last week it was just GONE).I have had to MacGyver it with little silicone O-rings, which is only marginally working if I am very very careful to be certain the rings are perfectly seated and positioned, even then it leaks and cannot be used as intended for pause-and-pour functionality.It's a gimongous pain in the patoot.I'm no spring chicken, so I have owned a lot of coffee makers. My 2 favorites from the past were Black+Decker models which made me expect a great deal more from this one.It now goes to the top of my Least Favorite Coffee Makers List."
Not bad. Not great. Just in between. We wanted a stainless steel carafe because we were sick of breaking and replacing glass ones. Larger than we needed but still ok. Biggest con is there is no hot plate. The carafe keeps it warm for only a little bit.
"For the money you spend on this, you might as well drop another $20 and get yourself something with better features like a coffee pot that is Wi-Fi. Here’s what I like about this, the thermal canister does an excellent job at sealing, and your coffee stays hot for hours. Because it seals so well, you can pour a cup the next day, heat it up and it stays fresh. Here’s why you can do better. You cannot set a daily brew schedule. The clock doesn’t havee an am/pm. You can set it up to brew up to 12 hours later but that’s it. That’s not suck a big deal to me. The deal killer is the amount of time it takes to make a pot of coffee. I poured water enough to brew ten cups this morning at 9:45, it is now 10:06 and it is just now ready.21 minutes to brew TEN CUPS OF COFFEE is a bit unacceptable in this day and age of technology and especially from a household’ brand such as Black & Decker. This is not the coffee pot for a busy household racing around to get out the door in the morning.  To its defense however, I will say that the coffee it brews is excellent when done. If you decide to brew the maximum of 12 cups, you can count on waiting 25 minutes. Also, the lid twists off almost too easily. So be careful when pouring. When you depress the button with your thumb by the handle when pouring, as you have to, the lid is subject to twisting and popping off the canister while you are pouring. This can result in your dumping the entire pot onto your counter, floor, or worse, yourself, or others. I am quite surprised that Black & Decker has not identified and fixed this design flaw and I am even more surprised that this item has not caused anyone to become seriously injured as a result of this problem. This is litigation just waiting to happen."
I would have given this a 5 star if it wasn't missing a couple of features. No signal to let you know its done or it doesn't shut itself off. But it does make a good coffee and it keeps it nice and hot.
"its nice but please keep in mind that this only keeps the coffee hot a certain amount of time, it wont reheat it as the base doesnt turn on. you either drink it as soon as its brewed or reheat it in the microwave"
"The positive things about this coffee maker are that the coffee drips directly into the thermal pot, keeping it piping hot from the get-go; the pot has a very wide mouth making it easy to clean; and the instruction manual is well-written and thorough. It also runs very quietly. The negative things are the coffee drips from the sides of the spout as you're pouring; the handle is very wide and not well-balanced making holding or carrying the pot awkward; and the control panel with the clock and brew timer doesn't light up. You can't set it without a flashlight shining on it."
"The handle on the carafe is too thick to wrap my hand around comfortably. I need to open the lid after it brews so excessive moisture can evaporate. If I had to do over, I might select a different model."
"Bought one of these in July 2023 for our office break room.  We normally use a Keurig for single servings, and got this to make carafes for group meetings.  After only 18 months of minimal use (maybe once a week for group meetings), it died.  Very disappointing quality for the price."
"I bought this when my old Melitta (Hamilton Beach) thermal coffee maker carafe developed an internal leak where the metal meets the plastic top. This one has more capacity at 12 cups versus 10, which is my preference. First impressions: The wide mouth carafe is much easier to clean, as the opening is big enough to squeeze your hand in for scrubbing. Brewing speed is a little slower than my old one, but not so much that it's an issue. The ""steal a cup"" feature works well so I can enjoy my first cup shortly after starting to brew. The thermal carafe is much more efficient than my old one at keeping coffee hot; it's still tongue burning hot an hour after brewing (bravo!). Makes a very tasty pot of coffee as well. Overall I'm very happy with it. One small gripe: the opening on top for pouring water in the reservoir is too small, and is in the rear corner with the top open, which makes filling a little awkward. Otherwise I'm very pleased with the quality and operation, and would buy this coffee maker again. Good job, Black and Decker.Update 12JAN22: OK after using this coffee maker for a while, I have a major gripe. It dribbles coffee all over my countertop and floor during and after pouring. Seems to be a design flaw on the spout edge that allows coffee to drip off of it to the metal outside of the carafe, then any surface below that. It doesn't seem to matter how carefully I pour; it still does it. My original rating was 4 stars; I'm taking back a full 2 stars because it's such a mess. I'll likely buy another brand soon and keep this one as an emergency backup. At my house, lack of a working coffee maker is truly an emergency. Black and Decker, you have some work to do if you want to compete in the coffee maker space. This one is pretty disappointing, but could be made acceptable with some minor design changes. A more convenient reservoir fill opening and a non-drippy carafe would be a good start. These things can be a pain on an appliance that you use every day.Update 12/30/22: I'm about a year into owning this coffee maker, and the thermal carafe has developed an internal leak. Coffee is leaking between the top plastic and the void between the double walls of the carafe. As there is no way to repair this, it pretty much renders the machine unusable as I don't want my freshly brewed coffee mixed with old, nasty, possibly moldy coffee that's trapped between the carafe walls. I've had several thermal carafe coffee makers do this over the years as the seal between the top plastic and metal carafe deteriorates. Anyways, it's a goner, kind of disappointing after only a year of use. Another star taken, and my overall review is down to one star. Something that costs this much should be made better."
"This was a great coffee maker, but petered out after less than a year of daily use, which is a bummer.  Drastically cheaper machines have lasted our household much longer than this."
"Loved the concept of a thermal carafe, BUT. I have had several cheap coffee makers that the burner plate gets too hot and burns coffee I was trying to hold for an hour. This one seemed like a good solution and I loved everything about it, save for the temperature of brewed coffee. I would pour coffee immediately after brewing and it was not quite hot enough. Pour from the carafe 30 minutes later and you would need to microwave it 30 seconds. I did try to heat up the carafe with hot water before brewing once. This did help, but an hour later the coffee was still not drinkable. I tested the carafe by itself with 200 degree hot water and it held temp very well in the first hour and a half…. I could only conclude that the carafe was fine and the coffee brewing temp was no where near the 200 it needs to be. I tested it with two different instant probes straight from the water sprayer as it was brewing and saw an average reading of 187 degrees. This might be fine for some people for the first cup, but not hot enough to make good coffee, and definitely not hot enough to keep in the carafe for the hour I needed. I gave it to a family member who only brews 4 cups at a time and drinks it immediately after brewing. I bought another very popular brand (Japanese warrior) with a burner plate. That one only brews at 192 but keeps it drinkable at 140 for the hour I need."
"I love the design, however, coffee temperature was not sufficient. Immediately after pouring a cup I could stick my finger into the cup and not be burned, coffee just warm."
"The coffee tastes great, but every time we pour a cup, coffee dribbles all over the counter.  Not a few drops.  A lot!  Probably wouldn’t buy again."
"It looks nice,  brews well, no leaking or anything but the coffee is not hot enough if you put even a small amount of creamer in it."
"5 stars, then 1 star and back to 3 stars..... it quit working.  I had to supply the warranty dept with a few pictures and now they are sending me a new one.  Yay Original post 5 stars:This coffee maker is so easy to use.  I've had some coffee makers where you had to search to find the ""on"" button but this one is right in front.  It distributes the water over the whole coffee area so it saturates all the grounds. In my opinion it makes a great cup of coffee.  I thinks it's a little overpriced because it is very basic.  But it's all you need.Then 1 Star:I received it July 22 2023 and it just quit working this morning, December 12.  It just won’t brew.I called service and talked to a representative but she was no help but said she’d turn it into research and they’d call me back. They didn’t.  I’m going to keep trying. Now 3 stars:I did keep trying and because it is still under warranty, they are sending me a new one no extra charge.  Kudos"
"DO NOT BUY this coffee pot.Our basic Mr.Coffee died on us so I was looking for a replacement. I wanted to try stainless steel to try to keep it hot longer. I purchased this not realizing that it didn't have a burner. While it does keep the coffee nicely hot, I feel that the extra step of preheating the stainless steel base ever morning is an annoyance.  I miss the burner set up because you could get the pot into the correct position.  This pot seems to be so sensitive to it's alignment and makes for not a very user friendly experience.  I've had countless mornings where I've made 12 cups and I end up with a coffee MESS all over my coffee bar and floor. The pot seemed to be in the correct position and wasn't overflowing. For some odd reason it just runs out and all over. It's an excellent way to start the day..... especially given the cost of coffee...... Because you have to heat the stainless steel, I don't use it to fill the coffee pot with water so I have to use something else. All of the added steps to the process of using this pot and the way it has functioned for me overall I strongly recommend you buy a different coffee pot. I'll be replacing this with a cheaper and more basis pot that does the job without the added frustration. I don't like the stainless steel base, the inside is stained and won't clean up after 1 month of regular use and cleaning. I also don't like how dingy the silicone gaskets look after this amount of time. Another bonus of going back to the basic Mr.Coffee- they don't have those parts!!I also can't say that this enhances the flavor of the brew at all. Not worth the price I paid and the frustration I've dealt with.***Edited to include the final update. I brewed 10 cups today and have determined that it will make a giant mess even if your alignment is correct. I have replaced this coffee pot with a Hamilton Beach Programmable Easy Access Delux. I am really pleased with all of its features and how I can already tell that my mornings will be improved given all of the considerate pluses with this model. It was made with the user in mind and it shows. It has cut out all frustrating aspects that I have dealt with for the last 48 days."
Brews amazing coffee. Thermal pot is awesome. Worked great for six months. I could never get the clean cycle to work even with reading the manual and watching videos. Eventually it locked into some kind of must clean setting and would no longer brew. Went in the trash.
"This is unbelievable heavy to pour my coffee let alone fill it.  Also, no filter comes with it which would be nice."
"This is a new edit of my original 5 star review. You'll see why.First, thank you to Amazon customer service. Our original order arrived with a massive hole that went through the outside box, the inside box and the machine itself - and the replacement was here less than 24 hours later.  Couldn't ask for more.The percolator itself worked like a dream.  The wide water reservoir was not too close to the basket, and the carafe lid is designed so it cannot accidentally accidentally fall off, or spill, and it pours well.  The option to make stronger coffee is welcome, as well.Unfortunately, after 7 months of once-a-day use, the percolator stopped brewing with half of the water still in the tank. Repeated cleans did nothing, and checking the lines for blockages turned up nothing. The casing was also getting very, very hot.  Time for a new one, but a different brand this time."
"As other reviews noted, the coffee leaks out the sides between the lid and pot, no matter how well the lid is sealed (and burned my hand). The coffee itself is very weak, even when using less water and the string setting. I’m returning it."
Just okay. I think all coffee pots are not great anymore. Not built to last or make good coffee. :(
"We were trying to find a solution because in the last couple of years we broke several glass coffee pots, just from them being too close to the edge or accidentally being brushed against or something like that and they fell to the ground and shattered on the tile floor in the kitchen. So, looking through all the different options on Amazon we saw this stainless steel coffee pot, and so decided to try it. For that need, it's been working well. As far as making coffee, it's what you'd expect. It makes a decent cup of coffee nothing spectacular (not like an AeroPress) but nothing bad either (like hotel coffee). It's been very reliable as well so no issues there. The only problems comes from the carafe, which is *impossible* to pour from without it dribbling all over the place. I am not sure why, but my wife and I have tried every single thing you can think of to pour coffee from it without it dribbling all over the counter, without success. In the photo you can see a couple of the drips that happen every time we use it, which necessitates cleaning up and wiping the counter all the time. If it weren't for this it would be a great coffee maker, but because of this dribbling issue it gets two stars taken off."
"This is cheap, lightweight plastic except for the carafe. It is not particularly easy to clean, and the carafe only keeps coffee hot if it is prefilled with hot water and allowed to sit, which defeats the purpose of having a programmable coffee maker."
"Not bad, nothing great. Doesn’t really keep the coffee hot, just warm. That’s the biggest drawback. It’s very average."
Instead of a glass liner like the old-fashioned thermos this pot has a lightweight aluminum or stainless steel liner that seems to absorb the heat of the coffee so that when you finally pour yourself a cup the coffee is 20% less hot than when it first entered and seems to become unpalatable within an hour.
"I’m not very happy with this purchase. It shipped without the mesh cup, I went out and bought one.  I’m having a problem with it dripping coffee outside of the carafe, so I stand there and babysit it.  Why this didn’t come with a mesh cup and filters is ridiculous.  However it does brew delicious coffee.I’d like to add that it’s most unhappy with this purchase and it’s too late to return it  I’ve come to the conclusion there is something wrong with the lid on the urn."
Need keep warm or some type special features for the price! I do like the SS pot.
"I can't believe this coffeemaker is as highly reviewed as it is. First of all, the stainless steel carafe is impossible to pour because of the border at the top that goes in about an inch all the way around. When full, you have to tilt it 90 degrees just to get a slow trickle. When it's almost empty it is literally impossible to get the rest out without coffee spilling out the sides of the lid, so if you want to avoid spilling and wiping up every time the only option is to pour every cup over the sink, unless you're fine wasting half a cup of coffee every day, and even then you'll still need to pour it out before you brew the next pot. I know the reason for this is to keep the coffee hot, and this isn't unique to Cuisinart. All stainless steel carafes seem to have this design. I just don't know why most people seem to think this is ok.Another issue is the steam. Of course all coffeemakers need a way to allow steam to escape, but the steam is particularly strong with this one. The 3 holes at the rear top allow a strong layer of steam to hit the bottom of your kitchen cabinet doors even if you have the coffeemaker pulled out to the edge of the counter, and it's not a light steam. Even after just one use there was a clear film that you can't remove with a wet cloth. It's only visible in certain light and at this point is something I can deal with, but I certainly don't want to keep exposing my cabinets to this steam. Cheaper coffeemakers I've had have the steam holes on the side, or they just aren't as powerful and so the steam is not as thick. Unlike the pouring issue, this issue can at least be solved by having the coffeemaker somewhere outside the range of cabinets, such as on a cart, so that the steam has more room to dissipate.The third issue is that it is pretty much impossible for condensation not to drip out of the holes in the back and down the coffeemaker when you open the lid after brewing a pot. Not a huge issue but again, for a supposedly quality coffeemaker, having to wipe up water dripping out the back after every single use is not something you should have to do. I bought this coffeemaker thinking it would be an improvement and make my coffeemaking routine easier, not more difficult, than the cheap one I've been using for the past 10-15 years.Of course I didn't start using this coffeemaker until about a month after I purchased it, so by the time I realized all its flaws the return policy had passed, so now I'm out 90 dollars and have a completely useless hunk of stainless steel and plastic. It certainly looks cool, and the functionality is exactly what I was looking for. It just amazes me that supposedly reputable companies like Cuisinart can build products like this with such clear shortcomings. Did they not test it out themselves? Did they really think it's ok to have a carafe that only pours a slow trickle when full, and CAN'T pour out all the coffee without having to turn it completely upside down and spilling? And how is it that people are ok with this? Oh well I guess my standards are just unreasonably high. I'm just so sad that this is where we're at as a civilization. Every time I look at the coffeemaker I'm reminded of all the time spent researching to find the right one, the excitement of finally opening the box, and then the slow realization that I'd have to do it all over again after discovering one ridiculous design oversight after another. It's still sitting on my counter because I haven't had the time or energy to look for another one, but when I do, I'm pretty sure one of the cheaper models with the glass carafe will be the way to go."
"This coffee maker makes good coffee and we like the thermal carafe.  We use paper filters versus the gold tone filter.  The water reservoir is very difficult to fill using the carafe and we usually spill some of the water.  While pouring coffee from the carafe into a mug it spills from around the top of the carafe lid.  The carafe is very difficult to place back on the resting plate because it catches on the filter basket spring.  And the power cord is 6""-8"" too short to reach our counter plug and we have to use an ugly extension cord.  The maker will not fit under our cabinets and sits just past the end of one.  They could have done better with the design.  I would definitely not buy another Cuisinart product based on this one.  I had to reset the clock two weeks ago and now it's 15 minutes fast again.  This is really not a good product."
"All the reviews here complaining about the clock running fast are true. If you never use the clock on your coffee maker it won't impact you but it's extremely annoying that not only does it run fast, but everyone is experiencing the same fast clock problem and the manufacturer doesn't do anything about it.  You might think this is no big deal, but it's incredibly annoying.Same goes for the carafe design.  I'm very tolerant of stupid stuff like this but it's another super annoying design flaw that makes filling the reservoir harder than it needs to be.  Sure, you don't really need to fill it all the way up, but eventually you get tired of dumping out a 1/2 cup of water into the sink every time you fill the thing. Why not just design the carafe so it can dump all the water out completely?  Again, not necessarily a major flaw but with so many coffee maker choices out there why bother with this one and it's annoying habits.makes perfectly acceptable coffee, pretty much like every other coffee maker does."
"(This machine is Stainless on the outside, but black plastic on the inside unfortunately.)Everything has gotten so expensive, I have been finding ways to reduce our expenses. With this coffee maker, we only need to use half the ground coffee our old machine used, and with the Bold option, we actually get MORE flavor than before. we also love the option of stealing a cup while the coffee is brewing, but dont expect that cup to be very hot if you steal it too early in the process.  The coffee is hotter when the brewing cycle completes, at which time it chimes Complete.This machine makes truly delicious coffee if you allow for its quirks, but if you overfill the cone with coffee grounds, its just one big mess. This is my second machine of this model….so, my advice,Get rid of the reusable filter. It does not hold enough ground coffee to brew anything other than a cup of water. We Use a large Bunn paper filter. It holds a lot of coffee.  Leave about an inch of space or more from the top to keep the brew cycle from overflowing.  If you like a good strong brew, always select the Bold option and dont make more than 8 cups at a time. We tried a pot without Bold on, and it was just water. no flavor.The programmable feature is so easy to use, I didnt even need the instructions..  Set the clock.  Then program the time you would like the coffee to be ready.  It is a wonderful feature.  And the best thing about this fantastic carafe is that the coffee stays fresh and hot for hours if you leave the carafe in the machine.The carafe is well built.  You dont even have to turn the lid to pour a cup, but I pour the first cup over the sink.  Its drippy if you pour soon after brewing.And we love being able to steal a cup mid-brew.We always rinse the lid, carafe and black cone after use, to keep them clear of grounds. It is a lot of work, and I will not buy another one when this one dies…too much mess and maintenance.Important Note: We used Seattles Best in our old coffee maker for four years.  But it had no flavor in this machine.  Then I remembered we always have to change coffees when we change coffee makers. The best coffee We have found so far for this machine is Starbucks medium or blonde roasts. Target almost always seems to have coffee on sale. We found Starbucks on sale there and stocked up.More than once a week we use a clean moist cloth to wipe out the cone base. It tends to collect grounds, especially if the filter is too full.Special Note: Soon after we bought this machine, my husband awoke one morning, and while still half asleep, stole a cup of coffee while it was brewing.  In his groggy state, he neglected to return the pot to the machine, so hot coffee ran down the white cabinet, over the white drawers, down the white baseboard of our freshly painted, just completed kitchen. The entire front of all of it is now stained brown from coffee.  😵‍💫"
"The carafe keeps the coffee hot nicely, but, no matter how much we try and work to position, we end up with coffee drips on the floor.  Also, though idiot valves are popular on today's coffee makers, they are a symptom of gadget disease; we're going to solve a small issue by guaranteeing a bigger problem.  These valves are good for people that don't know how to make coffee; they let the person remove the carafe to take coffee before brewing is done.  HOWEVER, when these valves plug, and they *will* plug, they make a coffee and grounds mess all over the counter.  The Cuisinart design at least makes removing the valve easy without having to use a drill."
"For comparison purposes, my previous coffee maker was from Ninja. I do not recall what model. That coffee maker had mental health issues!This is a middle of the range coffee maker. At best.1) Referring to it as ""Perfec-temp"" is funny.The coffee is hot but but hot enough. If you leave it on the burner for a while, then it is OK.Which leads me to2) The coffee was too acidicWhen the water does not extract properly from the ground coffee, in this case under extraction, the coffee is too acidic or perhaps you prefer the term ""bitter""This is one reason the end result is not hot enough.One suggestion (I read somewhere) was ""use the BOLD setting).If you like acidic mud, do that.Another suggestion is grind the beans finer. So I grind them into dust. I even have to grind already ground coffee into dust as opposed to what is in the package.Still muddy but less acidic.3) The carafe is poorly designedWhen you pour the coffee fro the carafe you will not get all of the coffee.I brew about one large mug at a time. When I pour from the carafe, I get about 2/3rd's on what is in the carafe.I have turned it completely upside down and shaken it to get more.To get most, I take off the cover.4) There is nothing in the instructions booklet about the ability to turn off the burner or how long it stays on.At least nothing I found. It must use magic to determine that you have finished what is in the carafe.I do not brew more than a cup or two at a time and never leave it on the burner for longer than it takes to bring it to the ""prefec-temp"" (sic)5) Brew strength is more about how much coffee you put it as opposed to the regular default or bold. I think that regardless of how you like the coffee, put it what you want as opposed to using BOLD. Your mileage may vary.6) The 1-4 button really makes little sense.The booklet claims the ""technology"" adjusts the way it makes the coffee if you are making less than 5 cups.Nah.7) ""Programmable""You press the program button to change the time and time if you want it to make the coffee at a certain time. That's all it does.One video shows the ability to change burner temperatures. Not this model.8) CleaningI have yet to run a cleaning cycle so I can't comment on that.As far as cleaning the unit, the reservoir is part of the machine base and opposed to my Ninja mental case which had a detachable reservoir. Easier to clean. To clean this one, you need to get your hand in there. Good luck with that.9) Charcoal filterThe booklet states the charcoal filter is provided to remove stuff from the water to make it taste better.Easy enough to replace. Prepare to buy a lot since you will be replacing it every 60 days or 60 cups. For me, 60 cups is about two weeks.Not likely I will be replacing it. I'd rather use bottled water than tap anyways.I am buying the next level up from this brand. This one will be my ""spare"". It works. I don't love it. I don't want to bother returning it. The only reason I am buying another from this brand is I have yet to find any brand that I like for a variety of reasons."
"Makes an excellent cup of coffee, but I can't wait for it to die so I can get a different one. My main gripe is that the carafe dribbles EVERY time you pour, so the counter is always a mess. The reservoir is difficult to fill with the carafe, but the cord is too short to move close enough to do it with the pull-out faucet. Fingers crossed that it breaks soon!"
I’ve had an older model of this coffee maker and love it. I needed a new one so I settled on this one. The only reason I’m not happy with it is because coffee splatters all over from the lid. I should have sent it back but I’m just dealing with it
"This is my second one , they don't last a year for the price , clean light keeps coming onand it did not run all the water through for the cofee  or the cleaning  and the carafe is a bad design"
"I got this to replace my Cuisinart DTC-975BKN, which worked but I accidentally broke part of the carafe lid. It's been discontinued and I couldn't find a replacement part, so new coffee-maker it was. Overall I'm satisfied with the DCC-3400P1, but I don't love it.CONS:Pouring water into the top of this thing is an exercise in manual dexterity. For some reason it's designed to splash right back out if you don't aim just right. I gave up using the carafe itself to pour; it's just too hard to aim. I might get a funnel.For some reason my thermos carafe version has a hot plate. I get that it's cheaper to make them all with the plate, but why leave it hooked up for the thermos versions? There doesn't seem to be a way to disable it with the controls. I don't think it's damaging the carafe but it's just a strange decision.The beeps when it completes a brew are very, very loud. I can mute them, but there's no way to decrease their volume. The older model had much softer tones. I don't know why it needs to alert the neighborhood that my coffee's ready.PROS:The ""bold"" setting makes a difference and it makes really nice coffee.The receptacle for the filter is well-shaped for paper filters. The DTC-975BKN was tight and I always felt like I was jamming the filter in, despite it being the right size for the machine. In the DCC-3400P1, it fits much better and I feel more confident about it.The showerhead drip splashes back up much less than my older model. Cleanup is easier.The carafe itself is much better designed than on my old DTC-975BKN. With the lid removed, the opening is nice and wide and I can get a scrub brush down in there easily.It's a little thing, but after an auto-brew, the auto timer turns itself off. In my old model, it would stay active, meaning it would automatically try to brew a pot the same time the next morning, unless I remembered to turn it off. Nothing bad ever happened because of it, but I like not having to worry about it turning itself on ""dry"" if I'm not home.Overall, it gets the job done. It just has some quirks and, IMHO, bad design elements."
"I was really looking forward to a new coffee pot and did a lot of research, read reviews and watched a lot of videos. As soon as it was delivered, I set it up because I wanted my new coffee maker to be ready first thing in the morning! I'm giving 3 stars just because I didn't make it past filling the reservoir for an initial cleaning run after unboxing and I have no idea how well it makes coffee, but that process alone was enough frustration and disappointment to box it back up for return. The machine looks great and the carafe is beefy with a lid that seals well. The controls are simple but provide a broad enough range of functionality that I'm sure it would be a good coffee maker *IF* it didn't have a couple of really glaring design flaws that combine to make the most basic parts of being a coffee maker a real problem. The heavy carafe makes using it to fill the reservoir difficult, plus there is a lot of trapped water in the bottom, so emptying it requires turning it completely upside down. Combine this with the really small area for filling AND the fact the lid won't move past 90-degrees vertical, it interferes with the ability to fill the reservoir. Also, the carafe pours...how should I put it...a little aggressively? It doesn't ""pour"" so much as ""stream"". So trying to hit that already-difficult-and-small reservoir fill target area is even harder. Finally, regardless of how slowly or carefully or using-both-hands-because-its-heavy method you use to try to fill the reservoir, because the grounds basket holder sits recessed with a gap all the way around, any spillage will bypass the ""stop and pour"" mechanism and flow directly down to the hot plate and your countertop. The lid I mentioned earlier? It traps extra liquid so that when you lift the carafe out of the machine, you'd better be careful because that freshly-brewed hotness has every chance of spilling off the top and on to your hand, countertop, fuzzy bunny slippers, etc. Returning and still on the hunt for a new coffee maker."
"Have had 3 of these over last 10+ years. Last one only lasted about 18 months before it started rusting. Bottom is rusted out now - and stained my granite countertops. Makes good coffee and easy to use, but not very durable or long lasting. And the red clean light comes on about  once a week - so it's usually an every weekend thing to run it through with vinegar and hot water on the clean cycle."
PRO Love the ability to make 1-4 cups and the brew is slow enough to let the coffee bloom.CONPoorly designed pouring spout  - requires you turn the carafe upside down to pour coffee. Ridiculous!!!
"This is a mixed review for me. I like the actual coffeemaker, but I am quite unhappy with the carafe.I like thermal carafes and my former one was hard to clean, I could barely get my hand inside it, so when I saw this one which was much wider I thought it would be easier to clean. In all the pictures it looks like a wide top, however, the actual opening is only 2-6/16” across! I can’t get my hand inside this one. The top collar is designed such that it’s even difficult to get the last 1/2 cup of coffee out of it. In addition, to keep spattering down when pouring coffee it must be held at a certain angle. Whoever designed this carafe did not test pouring from it or cleaning it. I expected better from Cuisinart.The carafe does keep coffee piping hot even 3 hours later, it’s attractive, and the handle is comfortable. That’s all I can say good about the carafe.The coffeemaker unit I am pretty pleased with overall. Setting the time is easy but the directions never mention AM or PM. When I initially set the time it read simply 7:05 for example. It was not until nighttime that I noticed the readout now said 7:05 PM. So if you’re setting the clock time or auto brew time and it’s evening, you need to cycle through the time setting until you see PM, otherwise, your auto brew will not operate the next morning.The base unit is attractive, the water fill & fill window are great, and the brew basket is easy to remove and rinse. I like that the “ready tone” can be turned off though it is not overly loud or long with the tone. I can set brew strength to my liking and it makes delicious coffee. Basically, I love the coffeemaker itself, it’s just the carafe should not only have been better described & photographed, but it should also have been much better designed."
Bought this to replace the similar model with a glass carafe. We wanted to try a thermal carafe as the heating pad on almost every coffee maker in existence ends up looking awful over time. This machine made good coffee as expected but the carafe design is not great. It was a very wide lip internally that prevents you from pouring out at least a cup of liquid without turning it completely upside down (which is then a bit messy). Will probably go back to a glass carafe model.
"This coffee pot is ideal in every other way... Programmable, large capacity, steel pot. Yet, it does not stay warm. I have people drinking off it between 7-9am and it's cold by the time my guests go to access it. So the fact that it makes such a large pot is useless."
"This coffee maker keeps coffee hot for a long time, but drips every time I try to pour water in to brew coffee and also when I pour coffee into the mug"
"It is misleading to say it keeps your coffee hot for hours.  True, first cup is hot, but after 45 mins or so the next cup is lukewarm - have to use the microwave if you like it ""steaming hot"".  It is difficult to pour.  It pours very slowly, and you don't know how much coffee is left unless you open the carafe.  Also, to fill with water is very tedious, hard to see the gauge if you have it in the corner of the counter top - have to slide it to the side to see it.I am returning, and reordering the Cuisinart I've used for years - makes a whole pot, you can disperse one cup at a time, has a gauge on the front showing how much coffee is left, and it's easy to fill.That's what I get for trying something new - stick to what you know."
"This coffee maker is just ok. It’s affordable & I mostly trust the brand so it’s probably a good buy but here are my complaints, in case it helps anyone.The design of the pot is terrible! I have had tea pots before with this same issue. I don’t understand why people continue to make them like this. There is a curved lip at the top & it collects liquid. There is no way to pour out the very last remaining coffee without spilling it everywhere. I always throw out about a 1/2 worth.And b/c of this issue, it’s never fully clean or dry. Even hanging upside down for hours, it won’t dry b/c water pools in that little lip so when you turn it back over, there is still water! The pot also doesn’t go in my dishwasher b/c it won’t situate between any of the prongs. So now I can only handwash a pot that won’t even fully clean or dry. It feels gross.The buttons are too easy to accidentally press. If you even graze the machine & lightly tap the buttons, they will engage. One morning I did that & accidentally turned off the silent button. When it was done brewing, the beeps coming from that thing woke up the whole house! Why is the finisher alert so loud? I like that you can silence it but be careful!While it does fit under my cabinets, it can’t actually live there b/c the steam it lets out of the top. It’s too close to the wood of the cabinet. So I have to pull that machine forward each time.Overall, not impressed. I may try to see if I can get a new pot to go with the machine."
"Inside two weeks I’ve received two Cuisinart coffee makers with the same problem - the electronic clock runs fast, real fast - gains 7 hours in 24.Makes great coffee and the carafe works as advertised, but if you want to program your morning coffee to be ready for you when you get up the speedy clock throws it off schedule.I called Cuisinart Customer Service - no trouble shooting possibilities - all they could do was offer a replacement.I decided not to return the 2nd Cuisinart coffee maker for a replacement and changed brands.All my other electronic clocks keep perfect time even when plugged into the same receptacle I used for the Cuisinart coffee makers."
"The overall coffee maker works fine to brew coffee and the carafe keeps the coffee fairly hot. However, there are some major design flaws that make using this a hassle.1. The carafe has a lip inside that means it doesn’t drain completely when pouring water in the basin or emptying the coffee2. The carafe lid leaks a little on every pour no matter how you hold it. I can reduce the problem by removing the cap before pouring3. The lid on the basin opens straight up and down, but because of issue 1 and the width of the carafe, it makes it so you can’t pour the whole amount of water in without making a mess or using another container to fill itIf these issues were resolved then it would be a good coffeemaker. As it is, the previous one I had from Cuisinart was far superior in design"
"This machine has a nice feature set, but the carafe is not well designed, and more importantly, it doesn't make very hot coffee.  I actually typically cool my coffee prior to drinking it, but even for me the coffee did not come out of this machine nearly hot enough, so I had to return it.  Maybe the one I got was a dud, but I kind of doubt it based on some of the other reviews.This was a pretty disappointing purchase.  My first Cuisinart with a thermal carafe lasted 15 years and made hot coffee, my second lasted only four years but at least made hot coffee, and this one went right back.  Not a good trend :(."
"I purchased this in November 2023.  Currently, I only need a small amount of coffee each morning.  On the unit water measure, that's about a 4 which gets me about 16 ounces of coffee.  My critical complaint - it just does not make good coffee.  There are two helpful settings, ""bold"" and ""1-4"" cups.  If I do not use either of these, coffee is very weak even though I'm using a large amount of grounds (way more than I've used on other machines).  If I use the bold/1-4 buttons (one or the other or both), the coffee is stronger, it's just not very good coffee.  It's bitter, as though it has been sitting in a pot for an extended period of time.  I've used the same coffee for a very long time so I know it's not the coffee.  I do not know how well this unit works for larger brews, but you're not going to get a decent cup of a coffee for smaller brews.  So I would say if you plan to use your coffee maker for frequent smaller brews, do not buy this one."
"i Love coffee.  making a pot of coffee is usually the first thing I do in the morning.  I had a Cuisinart DTC-975BKN for many years. It started leaking, & I found out that I was unable to find another one of the same as a replacement.  I wanted to stay with Cuisinart, & purchase Cuisinart DCC-3400.  Both Coffeemakers were for 12 cups' but the new version has a larger footprint. My kitchen is very small, & space saving is important.  The old design was simple & easy to clean .  My new coffeemaker makes clean up more difficult. I have to think that might have to spend more money to get a coffeemaker that will be more like my old Cuisinart; & likely have to be another brand ."
"Wanted an insulated carafe, so gave this a try.  I’ve had it for three years now so here’s my thoughts:Good things:Set time for morning brew is convenientDecent brew qualityKeeps coffee warm for over an hourCoffee screen easy to get in and out and cleanBad things:Pouring always drips coffeeCondensate from maker lid drips down back when setting up for a brewAlways coffee left in pot due to poor pour designCoffee isn’t hot hot, just warm"
I purchased this coffee maker to replace a similar one that had a glass carafe and was worn out.  The metal insulated carafe is very good in holding temperature.My wish list would be:1) have a button that turns on the warming plate to keep providing heat to the carafe2) the carafe is more difficult to clean vs my previous glass carafe.  Two reasons  - A) the opening is very small  B) the metal seems to stain with coffee.  I've never been able to get it as clean as new.I probably would not buy again
"It keeps the coffee hot and makes a good cup of coffee. The area where you pour the water is divided into two equally small areas so I have not filled it up once in four months without spilling at least a few drops of water. You really have to concentrate on pouring the water, and who wants that first thing in the morning? Furthermore, the spout sprays hot coffee when you’re pouring it from the carafe. The design doesn’t give you a nice straight, smooth pour. So that’s the second paper towel you have to use when making your morning coffee. The design from ten years ago was way better."
"The only reasons I’m even giving 2 stars instead of 1 is I possibly maybe could have found this out prior even if not exactly spelled out in the description and it was well made and did make good tasting piping hot coffee…for that first sip of the first half cup.I never realized this coffee maker was designed to shut off with no carafe heater the second it’s done brewing. Apparently the pot is supposed to keep it “nice and hot” but, didn’t do it for me at all. That was a deal killer. Poured that pot in to my old maker and began my return process Instantly.As I was cleaning everything the pot was difficult to really wipe clean like I usually do. Couldn’t imagine doing that daily, had to let it air dry to fully dry out. All that just wasn’t a combo for me. I really do like very very hot coffee whether it’s -10° or 75° in the morning. If I’m going to drink 2 cups I make 4 to constantly pour out a touch and top off regularly. It’s all part of the “jolt” I look for out of my morning coffee. After the first cup right after it was barely done brewing, every top off I was then tossing in the microwave for the heat.I actually thought it was defective until I read more and in a review came across a line that stated it simple, “It turns off after done brewing.” Just retuned and ended up buying a similar Cuisinart coffee maker that does stay heated which has done me well."
"My wife got me this for my birthday. We were in need of a new coffee maker, so she bought me this Cuisinart.I understand the reason behind getting a carafe style coffee maker, but it doesn’t fill the house in the amazing coffee smell.I have never let the coffee sit long enough to see how well the carafe style keeps the coffee warm, but where I thought there should have been insulation, ended up being a hollow space. I learned this a couple weeks into owning this coffee maker when I washed it in the dishwasher. I let the heated dry do its thing on the dishes, but when I pulled out the coffee pot, water came dripping out the mating surfaces.  I shook it back and forth for about 5 min trying to get the water out, but I can still hear some sloshing around between the outer shell and the inner wall.So I am not sure how long it would take for all the water to dry out from in between the inner and outer walls, or if mold might grow in it after a while.So if you decide to buy this coffee maker, hand wash the carafe and do not submerge it in water. Also DO NOT buy the white one!! In less than a week the white is already stained brown from the coffee, even though I clean it every day.Because of the build quality, which could possibly turn into a health issue (not willing to find out), I would definitely look into a different coffee maker.Also, no matter how you try and pour the coffee into a coffee mug, at least a drip or two will end up outside of the mug on the counter.My wife and I have made it a game trying to re-learn how to re-pour coffee without spilling it. So far we have never succeeded. So do yourself a favor and buy a different coffee maker."
"I enjoy a good cup of coffee every morning. I have Zojirushi Fresh Brew which I love but it was only a 10 cup and with my older daughter now drinking coffee we needed something bigger. I am bias towards thermal carafes. They keep the coffee hot enough without using a hot plate which can turn the coffee bitter (typically I begin my first cup a couple of hours before the other family members do). I chose this Cuisinart because there are not a lot of 12 cup thermal carafe options out there.Cons:1) The reviews are true. The second you open this thing it smells like plastic.  The kind of plastic smell you get from old screwdriver handles.  I read the reviews and bought it anyway because I was willing to clean it.  It took one clean cycle using vinegar, two full water cycles and one coffee brewing cycle, but it went away.2) The carafe is short and fat which is fine aesthetically, but its very hard to get the remaining few ounces out of it (yes, of course I take off the lid). We couldn't use it to fill the tank without making a couple of trips and even then, we couldn't get the last of the water out without going to the sink and turning it completely upside down3) The overflow hole on the back of the unit is positioned in a place so that if you are not careful, you will pour water through the overflow hole as you are filling up the resivoir.4) Some other reviewers complained that it is a slow pour. It isn't. They just aren't use to a thermal carafe. If you can't wait the additional 3 seconds, you should reconsider your addiction. However, when pouring coffee, it splatters. you have to keep the spout of the carafe inside your mug because droplets shoot out diagonally and get all over the counter.5) At this price point, it felt cheap. The carafe is quality, but the machine itself is a very light flimsy plastic.Pros:1) Makes a quality tasting coffee2) Easy to program3) This carafe kept the coffee much hotter than the Zojirushi Fresh Brew I had."
"Excited to get this stainless steel carafe but it has not met my expectations. I have purchased the glass version three times and loved it but this carafe is har to fill and pour.  The worst thing by far is the digital clock.  It will not keep time and is now running two hours ahead of the actual time. This means I can never program the coffee maker to make coffee at a specific time, since it will never be right. If I set the clock on Monday, by Friday it is 15 minutes ahead, so in a month, it’s an hour off.Do not recommend!"
"Third time buying. First one no issues except a drippy pour. This was managable due to a hot cup and a thermal pot. The second one had drippy pour and the time jumped by 30 ,minutes,  often. Sent that one back and the replacement has a drippy pour and still time jumps. Hot coffee but unreliable pre set for morning brew."
"Cuisinart needs to modify their Brewing program. This coffee maker will brew a pot of coffee pretty quick but I believe it runs the water through at a less than optimum temperature and rate because the coffee brewed is not near as good as my 10-year-old Mr coffee, which takes just a little longer to brew a pot. But that coffee maker has become somewhat intermittent. Also the interior design of the carafe needs some work, you have to tilt it excessively to empty the pot, and even when full it just pours very slow out of the carafe. I'm stuck with this one for now, but I'm on the hunt for one that makes a truly great cup of coffee."
"I had a similar Cuisinart coffee maker in my office for years. I i purchased this one for my home, but it has been a disappointment. The thermal container is difficult to use and to clean.  The coffee does not remain hot after first cup.  I purchased  a glass carafe for ease of use but have to reheat coffee in microwave.  I would not purchase this version again.  I feel like I’m wasting all my good coffee bc it takes so much to get a flavorful brew.  I’m looking for a replacement."
"To begin, I like the Cuisinart products I currently own and based on this I made the assumption of security in purchasing a coffee maker from the same people who brought us the food processor. When making appliance purchases I must take into account my bride likes frufru stuff. (I could care less how it looks. Mr. Coffee doesn't offend my sense of aesthetics and produces an adequate consumable fluid.) As a result, we have purchased Krups Coffee Systems in the past as a noncompromise compromise. As you have likely deduced, I'm not a coffee snob and as such am not qualified to comment on flavor, etc. I'm more focused on function and therefore will restrict my comments to that realm. Here it goes:1. It makes coffee. So it's got that going for it.2. I like the metal basket. It doesn't require a filter and rinses out easily enough.3. The control panel is not as intuitive as it could be. I've had it 3 days now and preflight the coffee every night as is my custom and have yet to wake up to fresh brewed coffee. I'm confident there's something in the as-yet-unread instructions that will help.4. I like the fill window as it is Kalashnikov simple. Easy to see how much water is needed and where to stop.5. I like the carafe concept because it allows me to take the pot with me to the table eliminating trips back and forth if I want and keeps the coffee hot. And yet, herein lies my chief gripe. This carafe was clearly designed by a person who is neither a coffee drinker nor an engineer.  The spout assembly is such that you must tip the pot to a near inverted position in order to pour the last 10% of its contents. I cannot stress this enough to the party responsible for the design of this pot: A POT SHOULD EMPTY COMPLETELY WHEN TIPPED 90 DEGREES. I know this most basic technological concept fits neatly within the boundaries of the laws of physics since I've seen it done before.I take two stars away for this most basic flaw as it reveals itself with EVERY pot of coffee made. We'll see how long I can tolerate it before throwing it away, which I suppose would constitute ""easy to clean""."
"I ordered this when my trusty Mr.Coffee suddenly died. I was encouraged by all the great reviews on Amazon, and the fact that this coffee maker is on just about all of the ""best coffee makers 2019"" lists. I also liked the looks, which coordinate well with the rest of our stainless steel appliances.First the good-- this does indeed make good coffee. It was nice and hot and it stayed hot for a long time in the carafe. That second thing was kind of a moot point because I'm in the habit of transferring freshly brewed coffee into a thermal carafe anyway. I drink hi-test and my wife takes decaf, so I transfer coffee to two different carafes and leaving it in the Cuisinart carafe would be inconvenient for one or the other of us.About that carafe-- it's much heavier than I anticipated,especially when filled. Not a deal breaker but something to consider if you have any hand/arm weakness. It's design has two flaws that really annoyed me. The coffee comes out of the filter onto a sort of well on the lid of the carafe. The bottom of the well is flat,maybe very slightly slanted towards the center. As a result, when I took the carafe out to pour a cup there was always coffee sitting in the well which would then slop out when I started to pour, usually onto the plate beneath the carafe, or the countertop. If I swirled the pot a bit before pouring I could get that coffee to go into the carafe, but that really shouldn't be necessary.The carafe has a sort of shoulder inside where the steel meets the plastic and this makes it impossible to fully empty without turning the carafe completely upside down. After using the carafe to fill the reservoir with water, I had to go back to the sink to dump out the remaining water which was a pain in the butt.A couple of days ago I brewed a pot of coffee using the BOLD setting. When I tried to brew a second pot of decaf, BOLD did not work. That,for me, was the deal breaker as I always use the BOLD setting on any coffee maker.Also, my humble Mr.Coffee kept that BOLD setting unless I changed it, but on the Cuisinart I had to hit the BOLD button every time. I can't imagine why they made it work this way. Back it goes!"
"We have purchased Cuisinart brand coffee makers for 20 years or more. This is the first one that I regret buying. The thermal carafe is heavier than other thermal carafes I have used in the past (with modern advances in material science, this should be better designed). The container itself it a bear to clean, the opening in the top is too small for my husband to get his hand in and mine barely fits. But the worst feature is that it leaks! The lid, even when well screwed in, following the manufacturer's instructions, leaks when poured. Every morning I wipe up about half a cup of coffee off my counter. Throwing in the coffee-soaked towel!"
"We returned this.  It looks very nice, the timer functions fine, the coffee tastes good.  One slightly annoying design aspect is the water reservoir.  There are two smaller areas into which you can pour the water to fill the reservoir, and there is a piece of the main system between these two areas.  If you happen to pour water atop this piece of the main system, the water will run into the grounds basket.The real reason we are returning this, is that we measured heat loss from the carafe using food thermometers and checking at a few intervals and found the newer model seems to lose heat slightly faster than the 14 year old Cuisinart model we have kept until now and want to replace.  We measured the water temp after pouring into a cup immediately after filling a full carafe.  The temp was 160 F in both this new model as well as in a Cuisinart thermal carafe coffee maker purchased circa 2007.After 70 minutes both still measured 160 after pouring a cup.After 130 minutes, both measured 150.After 240 minutes, the new coffee maker new was 130 but the 2007-vintage model was 135.After 300 minutes, the new was 114 and old was 118.After about 12 hours, new was 67 and old was 80.I GUESS the reason for very slightly higher rate of heat loss in the newer model has something to do with the newer models more slimly designed carafe lid.  The older model has a beefy lid with a complicated system of valves.  The new model has a much thinner lid that lacks that kind of valve system.The newer model also seems to splatter some coffee to the side just slightly when it pours.This is NOT a bad coffee maker.  It's good.  But we happened to be looking for more of an upgrade."
I have always loved my Cuisinart coffee makers but this one has a poor carafe design.  The carafe is much shorter and wider than my previous one.  There is a wide lip inside the carafe that prevents being able to pour out all the coffee or water.  I literally have to shake the carafe upside down to get all of the coffee or water out.  It makes great coffee but the carafe is very disappointing....hence the 3 stars.
"I bought this a couple months ago to replace my Coffee Ninja that died after 3 years.The Cuisinart has a nice look.  It is much bigger than I need.I am the only hot coffee drinker in the house, so I typically make two or three cups at a time.  This is probably not where this machine shines.  I suspect it is better for full pot brewing.The stainless pot keeps coffee hot for about 30 minutes and ""warm"" for a couple hours.  It would likely stay hot longer if I made a full pot.  The design of the pot and its top appears to be intent on keeping the coffee hot.  Unfortunately, it makes it difficult to pour a cup of coffee.  It only allows for a slow pour and you need to tip the pot way up (90 degreed) to compensate for the shape of the pot.  I typically take the top off when I pour, which is a hassle.The brew cycle takes about 14 minutes, so I typically use the timed brew.  Which is fine if you know when you want your coffee.The machine will not brew unless the pot is perfectly centered.  As a result I have returned after 15 minutes to find no coffee. The only way to know it is working is to listen for the steam to start.  Annoying when your in a hurry and doesn't help when you use the timed start.It is otherwise easy to use.  Very obvious how to add grounds and water, set clock and timer etc.It took over a month of use to figure out the proper proportions for the perfect cup.It seems as though it has fewer parts to fail than the coffee ninja, so hopefully should last longer than 3 years.  I may find a better machine by then.Overall, I am reasonably satisfied with my purchase.  Frankly, I would not buy it again."
"Heavy carafe. Reservoir opening either side but small and unwieldy to fill using the carafe. In other words, using the carafe results in spilling water over the exterior.Efficient in its brewing time, though.Comes with a removable charcoal filter basket for the reservoir. The material of which imparted an odd flavor to the coffee I was brewing.I bought it because it was highly rated. It think it is highly overrated."
Hard to fill the reservoir and empty the carafe☹️
"My product did not come with instructions; I had to find them online.  It was too heavy and difficult of a product to return.  Makes me wonder if I received a new item?  Also, warranty papers or any other unknown pertinent information was not included in purchase.  Aside from the missing documents, the coffee maker once cleaned, makes good coffee."
"Miss my old pot that died, with water holder, it held coffee for few days after brewing! Used once , haven’t been able to get coffee right.Would send back but missed date."
"… does not keep coffee hot for very long.The coffee maker is easy to operate & brews coffee well; however, the SS carafe is not well designed bc pouring causes splashing from the lip & makes a mess outside of cup.  The coffee flows out from pot, at a very slow rate, bc the way the pot lid is designed there is a small flap controlled opening that is too small.  Pouring the last bit of liquid from the pot is a two handed task bc it requires >180 degree turn of wrist & for me is not possible unless I become a contortionist.  It requires two hands to finish off the last pour, very annoying.The carafe keeps coffee hot for approx. 1.5 hrs.  & this is in summertime.  It will be much less in winter.  I get that the carafe is designed to keep coffee hot but it really doesn’t do this very well; in all fairness I only brewed four cups or less & never filled the carafe up.  It probably would keep coffee hotter longer in this situation.In conclusion, the coffee maker works well but the SS carafe does not work well at all."
I like the brief time the Cuisinart takes to brew the coffee and the programming features.  I wish the openings to the reservoir were larger in diameter and that the thermal carafe didn't need to be rinsed with hot water to insure the freshly brewed coffee stays hot.
"The coffee maker itself is really good. Looks good, works well, good features BUT… the carafe ruins it all! You have to make an extra cup of coffee to leave at the bottom of the carafe because you can not pour it all out without tipping thr carafe upside down! ITS RIDICULOUS that any engineer even let this enter their brain. Dumbest design possible.Its so bad I encourage you to buy a different model. THIS ONE SUCKS!!!I wish I could return itI will probably just throw it away and get something esle"
"There aren't many thermal carafe makers out there so I was happy to discover this one. So close to a great machine, but not quite.PLUSES - Carafe keeps coffee hot for several hours - 12-cup capacity is nicely larger than the typical 10-cup (since ""2 cups"" in the machine equals about one 12 oz. mug) so one pot more likely to caffeinates 2 people using mugs ;-) - Relatively compact footprint for capacity - Lid over coffee filter and water reservoir opens up a full 90 degree lending greater access - Not over complicated; does just enough without introduce excess opportunities for failureMINUSES- You have to turn the carafe nearly upside down (180 degrees) in order the empty it.  Good thing I don't have arthritis...yet- The carafe lid does not move/pop open to pour coffee with a good flow.  Instead, it releases coffee in a very fine, slow, stream which creates three problems:  a) spatters coffee around the cup (so don't pour over placements or a table cloth!)  b) takes forever to pour (especially if you're trying to avoid spatter  c) fine, low-volume stream doesn't sound like you're pouring a generous cup of great coffee. I'm reminded of other fine stream, water-like sounds that kills my happy breakfast mood- Using the carafe to pour water into reservoir is cumbersome. Given the small corner space of the reservoir itself, added to the carafe design, it's easy to pour water into the coffee filter basket accidentally rather than just into the corner reservoir.- Stainless steel sides show fingerprints readily. Given I have to touch/move the device from underneath my cabinets each day in order to open the lid to add coffee grinds and water, it always looks bad unless I clean each time I use itThere is nothing damaged or broken about the device so I can't return it but these design flaws are set to annoy me for years to come. Maybe I should try more decaf..."
"I read directions and ran out thoroughly with water. I'm glad I was watching. When brewing started the water was running all over counter. 12 cups of hot water. After looking everything over, was discovered there was a plastic piece that didn't completely get punch through which blocked area on lid where coffee should go. Wasn't easy to see this as it was under the spout area"
"Nice looking but some fatal flaws: worst one is that the coffee, even freshly brewed, is not all that hot,  Leave it in the carafe for even a half hour and it's lukewarm.  The other problem is you have to turn the carafe almost entirely upside down to pour everything out of it.  Makes it difficult to fill the tank with water.  Not recommended."
"I thought I’d love this coffee maker but I couldn’t be more disappointed. The water tank opening is super small and water is easily spilled trying to fill it (I resorted to using a pitcher that now live on my counter just for this purpose). I really don’t like the design of the carafe - I have to take the lid off and practically pour it upside down to get all the coffee out. I also don’t have a dishwasher and even though my hands are small, it’s difficult to clean the inside of the carafe due to the small opening.I thought I’d love it and threw the box away immediately. I’m now regretting that because if I still had it I’d most certainly be making a return.All that being said, it DOES make a good tasting coffee."
"I bought this coffee maker for my husband in May 2023. He's not a coffee snob, so when asked for his review he said: it makes coffee. Plain and simple. However, twice in the past month, (and a few times before that) he's turned the coffee maker on, stepped away, and come back to a countertop full of coffee. He's a smart guy. He knows how to put the lid on the carafe, how to place it carefully on the burner, how to put the filter in with coffee, yet somehow the machine is just a bit too finicky and requires precise alignment. I've written the manufacturer. Maybe we have a defective machine. Hoping to get a replacement that will cause less of a mess. Will update this post if I get a response."
"Nearly 20 years ago I wrote an article titled, ""Everything I know about I.T. I learned from Mr. Coffee"". Add Cuisineart to that list.The piece was about the challenge finding a coffee maker that met some minimum qualifications:- Easy to clean- Easy brew basket placement: Avoid the situation where coffee backs while brewing.- Pour spout that is deep enough to avoid coffee spilling off to the side while pouring.It is that last item that Cuisinart joins a long list of coffee makers that fail.I'm sure they have a product design team but I question whether they have used their own product.The unit brews coffee fine... but so does the $14 maker I purchased as an emergency & travel maker. If I am spending $100+ I would expect the carafe to pour with amazing efficiency. The glass carafe on their 14 cup maker is bad but the metal carafe is miserable.As you pour it spills and splashes to the left and right. If I go super slow, it is just small dots of coffee all over the counter. Try to pour any quicker and it is a disaster.Anyway.. We're returning this unit and will continue our search for a company who's product designers test the products they're making."
"The taste of the coffee is very good. The coffee stays reasonably hot for several hours., but  I would not buy this maker again. It is difficult to fill the reservoir without making a mess. At times it does not pour neatly. The resting plate has rusted badly. At this time I’m planning to buy a different coffee maker."
"I bought this because it's a quality brand and it was supposed to make hot coffee and keep it hot in the thermal pot.  I understand that the pot needs to be made out of insulated metal but the down side of this is that you can't see the coffee.  It has a pause-and-serve feature but there's no way of seeing if there's enough coffee for the first cup.  And claims that it makes nice hot coffee are not true.  It's a good looking coffee maker but I bought it to make coffee, not look at it.  Sorry Cuisinart but I would not buy again."
"Cuisinart, the name is respected for its quality, durability and dependability.  Our first one lasted 18 yeas and was always a great brew.  This new one brews coffee as well as you would expect of Cuisinart.  That gets 5 stars.  It is sturdy and good to see on your counter, another 5 stars.  However, the new design has pushed me to the edge of giving it away.  The carafe's new shape makes it impossible to empty without twisting your wrist into an unnatural position.  This new shape combined with the new tower also causes problems.  When filling the tower, the water hits a more bulky post in the middle so it splashes out.  In order to avoid that, you must pour slowly.  Also, to get all the water out of the carafe, it must be turned completely upside down and the water maneuvered to the spout–if you don't want ""unbrewed"" water remaining in it.  Turning it completely upside down would be fine IF the new wider, stout carafe was able to fit without having to push the tower's lid beyond its limit.  It is so wide that the spout misses the tower unless you either push the cover beyond its limit OR settle for some water to remain in the carafe.  I am expecting the lid to eventually break off because of that.  I thought I would be able to adjust to a new way of filling the tower, so I didn't return it.  I should have returned it.  My wife is fine with the residual water left in the carafe, but her wrist can't handle the necessary twist - she has to use both hands, pour slowly (so as not to splash onto the counter) and wiggle it around when it is completely upside down to get the water out.  So…she doesn't use it.  I make the coffee, but now it is served with chagrin.  It used to be a pleasant experience."
"I bought this to replace an old Braun insulated carafe coffee maker. I bought this item because it seemed similar - insulated carafe, makes about the same about of coffee, plus this version has a timer so you can set it to auto-start the next morning, which my Braun did not have!Generally, I'm happy with the machine itself. It's the carafe that's so frustrating, and really demonstrates the gap between the Braun and this model.First, the ergonomics of it - you have to tip the carafe nearly all the way over to get the coffee to come out, which means that that any liquid that's formed on the top of the lid (and there will always be some from the drip mechanism) will spill out and fall on the floor/your hand. Why do you have to tip this thing so far? The Braun had a much easier and logical tip angle to empty it out.Worse, because of how far you have to tip it to get the liquid out, you cannot use the carafe to fill the water reservoir! The lid of the reservoir doesn't open up that far, and because of how far you have to tip the carafe to empty it, you will find that the lid prevents you from positioning the carafe over the reservoir enough to empty it out. Which means you have to find something else to fill the reservoir. Just poor design and planning.Lastly, I brewed a few cups, had one cup before I walked my daughter to school (a 15-minute round trip), and when I topped off my coffee cup, discovered that the coffee in the carafe was only lukewarm. After less than an hour! The old Braun would keep coffee hotter for longer.So really, I'm very disappointed in the carafe. If they could fix the ergonomics and insulation, this would be a great maker. But the carafe is just too poor to recommend this maker."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            As someone who owned and loved an earlier version of the thermal pot coffee maker by Cuisinart, I had high hopes. Unfortunately, six months in and I’ve discovered that this doesn’t compare. While the coffee tastes great and the addition of a water filter is helpful, they are not great enough to outweigh the negatives: 1) The paint on the resting plate chips and rust forms making a mess; 2) the resting plate is hot to the touch after brewing and the thermal carafe does not retain its heat as well as older model; 3) there is a mess to clean off the counter after filling maker with water and after dispensing coffee.  Some here have said you need to pour slower. It is true that with some mindfulness you can minimize the splatter, but not eliminate it. On the other hand, do you really want to slowly and mindfully manage your daily coffee? If you pour the ordinary way, you will get a mess. Every. Single. Time. On the plus side, Cuisinart has stood by it’s product and is sending me a replacement. I asked if I could get a discount on a different one as this one is a dud on many levels, but no, warranty covers only replacement. Think twice and buy once — and not this one.Edit: Added another star because I was able to exchange this for a replacement through Cuisinart with truly no hassle at all. Also, the new carafe does NOT sputter and splash it’s contents when pouring! So there must be some variation in production lots that account for the splash factor. Hopefully the rust issue is lot specific as well!  Time will tell.Second Update: second coffee maker is now rusted and dripping as well (gasket??). I’m not going to bother exchanging this one. I will just buy a non-Cuisinart next time."
"Bottom very rusty after 2 yrs.  We overfilled water one time, after that we were very careful not to overfill.  Also thermal carafe very difficult to keep the inside clean, cannot get hand inside to scrub.  Disappointed, we’ve had Cuisinart for many years. We purchased a different brand this time."
The opening of carafe is a bit small and you have to poor completely upside down to empty pot and fill cavity with water. I use a cup instead but think this is poor design.
"This coffee maker brews an excellent cup of coffee, offering options for both bold and regular drip brews.The carafe leaks drips when pouring and when the last cup is poured, it splashes everywhere.  This stainless steel carafe is a new design that has so many flaws it had to be returned.  It is surprising that a company as good as Cuisinart would let this new carafe design make such a mess that this great improved coffee maker had to be returned."
"Coffee comes out bitter, either on regular or bold setting"
"Got this coffee pot. Took one ""like new"" paid $65.00. When it got here, the coffee pot was broken, got on line, was sent to Cuisinart, made a report for REPLACEMENT, not even a message.Came back here to file a second request, for REPLACEMENT,  but NO REFUND only.I love this product, but how I am being treated, or IGNORED, IM VERY UPSET!so, I would highly recommend, not dealing with this company.Size is nice, makes coffee awesome, can't tell ya about the speed, it blew my fuse, and being disabled, could not get my lights back on until next day. This pot is made of some pretty heavy duty plastic,  and it's a drip pot.I cannot print the return address, and I have no way to drop off at place to drop it off. I have no box to put it in. I'm unable to drive, so do not own a automobile. My doctors come to meI wanted a replacement, not the refund!UPDATE: ONLY received 1/2 a refund. I recorded this pot. Suppose to be here in 2 days, 4 weeks later I get it. This pot is brand new, right. Makes coffee fast, however coffee is not as hot as it should be, sometimes I even have to heat it up in the microwave. I have several items from Cuisinart and none of them are this bad as this coffee pot has been for Me. So I'm saving for a different one with the Cafe to keep hot coffee hot, not warm coffee coldI'm majorly unhappy, and to make things worse, Cuisinart don't give a rats ass!"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This coffee maker is our 3rd cuisinart we have purchased and is replacing one that we have used daily for the past 10 years.  It makes great coffee. I would not buy this coffee maker again simply because it drips coffee on the counter every time! Although the insulated pot keeps coffee hot, I can not move this away from the sink because it has to be poured where it can drip. Very disappointing!"
"I like that the coffee stays warm without a heating element underneath, and the filter system is fine I guess.The major negative is the carafe itself:1. The thing cannot easily be cleaned because of the narrow opening.  I can get a bottle brush in there, but I'd love to wipe it out with a towel too, and I don't have little tiny baby hands that will fit in the hole.2. There is a leak between the plastic lip and the metal body allowing water to get inside, and this can cause all sorts of wonderful things to grow inside the air gap.  There is a screw at the base of the handle but I don't know if I'll damage the carafe if I start trying to pry it apart to drain and clean it.3. The thing pours horribly.  I take the lid off to pour so I don't have to damn near flip it upside down just to get a cup going in the morning.So, can I easily find a replacement carafe or am I just out $130+ ?"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            We have an older version of this in our RV. It is hard to fill like this one, but quiet and works well. This new one is awful and scary. It is so loud with a popping noise when it brews, it woke me upon a panic the first morning at 3:30am.The machine is super messy. It’s impossible to get the water filled without spilling as the input area is small and next to the lid. You already forced to use a separate container, not the carafe to do this.After it’s done brewing, the entire unit is wet. The top of the coffee carafe, the inside of the brew area, the back of the unit where steam comes out, etc. I have been wiping the entire thing and my counter off every day.Additionally, it’s dangerous! Don’t open it within 5 min of it being brewed. I almost burnt my face off the first day when I went to take the grounds basket out to dump it. It blows a HUGE amount of steam out when you open the lid.Lastly, it heats the coffee to 170 degrees. While this is nice to keep coffee hot all day, my husband burned his mouth the first day, not knowing it would be this way.Save your money. Not worth it. Going back to Amazon.*Update, just over a year from buying. We kept this thing, and the bottom plate where the carafe sits got rusty. I have no idea why! Two strikes, I won’t be buying again. 🙄🤦‍♀️"
"I read many of the reviews before deciding to purchase this coffeemaker. I decided to take a chance on it despite some concerning comments since most of the reviews were positive. What I discovered through personal experience after about a week of use is that what makes it good is also what makes it bad.The carafe's design allows the coffee to stay hot for a longer period of time. But because of the way it is designed, it can't be used to measure how much water is being poured into the coffeemaker. Before, with my previous coffeemaker, I was able to use my glass carafe to do so. Now, I have to use a measuring cup instead.In addition, the design of this carafe makes it very difficult to clean. The opening on top is too small for adult hands to reach inside to clean. So other methods are needed to do so.Finally, in order to pour all the coffee out of the carafe, it has to nearly be upside down above the cup. This is due to a design that is meant to keep the coffee hot and for longer.With all this being said, the coffee made from this machine tastes really good. So, it's a trade off. Is there a way that a coffee maker can keep coffee hot and tasty without the drawbacks I just mentioned at around the same price I paid for this machine? I don't know, but that is why this coffeemaker gets three stars from me. Buyer beware!"
"We have always had good quality with previous Cuisinart Coffee makers.  Not this one.  This one worked well for about 30 uses.  Water started overflowing at the basket.  I emptied it, cleaned it and went through their trouble shooting tutorial.  Still doesn't work.  I have email the manufacturer.  I will update this review if or when I hear back from them."
"We have had this maker for 2 years now, so that's good. The coffee timer works great.  The coffee stays hot, and is decent using the extra strong button.  With that said there are 3 very bad design flaws that pretty much out number anything good.  1.  The carafe is pretty much impossible to clean unless you are a child, an adult hand cannot get into the opening to clean the entire surface.  2.  The opening provided to add water is at the back of the unit and the lid and the lid hinge give very little space to add the water. 3.  That max fill line, it is true max you cant overfill past that line, if you do it will overflow out the back.  This is not hard to do because you are trying to watch how your pouring the water in.  Hope this helps if your trying to decide on a new machine."
This was my third Cuisinart - the first one was broken during my kitchen renovation. :-(  Then I purchased this one - the clock was fast - 15 minutes every day.  So I got a new one - same problem.  If you want to program your coffee maker this feature is important!  Now I'm looking for a new brand.
"This machine looks nice and makes good coffee, and it stays nice and hot. But the carafe is a really poor design. You literally have to upend it to get all the coffee out, and it splashes due to the wide lip on the carafe."
"Place it on a mat to protect your surface and keep an eye on the area around the cord!  Luckily we keep our coffee maker on a silicon mat designed to prevent spills from getting to the surface of the furniture. It is also in an open area, at the end of our counter.  Luckily I noticed the water gathering under the back, around electrical cord before it became a problem.  When making coffee, steam and condensation gather on the inside of the lid.  After the coffee is done, when you lift the lid, water trickles down the back of the coffee maker. Now, there is a little 'lip' on the back that I presume is supposed to catch and prevent the water from making its way to your counter-top.  ahhh no... it just waits until you least expect it then drools its way on down .  Basically that little lip just redirects the water along until it dribbles off the lip and down the unit, gathering around the bottom.  I used the coffee maker several times before I noticed there was a puddle of water all under the unit, around and under the cord.  The first picture is after one use -my opening the lid to remove the old grounds.  This is a rather serious design flaw.UPDATE:  Down-grading my review to one star!  Bought on May 6, 2023 and the water gathering at the back is just ridiculous.  The added pictures show how much water gathers when as you open the lid (to prepare the next pot).  I'm not talking immediately after the last pot either...  I make ONE pot each morning.  Next morning, after I get rid of the old grounds and grind fresh beans, I have to pick this *&$&#^ thing up and remove all the water from under it.Update 2: We made it two months before finally deciding it just wasn't worth the headache.  I have gone with buying a replacement (Mr coffee carafe with the removable water container).  That's what we had before and it is just so much better than this thing.."
"I don't notice any difference in terms of the quality of the brew compared to my previous coffee maker (a $20 one!), so no issues there. It also keeps the coffee warn for hours, so that is a plus for sure.  I have had a cup 4 or 5 hours after brewing and it still tasted great.What I do not like about this coffee maker is that the carafe is just so heavy - even with nothing in it.  I have on/off bouts with tennis elbow and on some days can hardly pick the thing up!  It is also VERY hard to empty all the liquid out of it so I now have to use a separate water jug to load water in the machine which just int's very efficient (on my old one, I would fill the carafe with water after I cleaned it and then pour directly into the machine - now I have to clean the carafe, empty it, and fill a separate vessel with water and then dry that off).The other thing I do not like about this coffee maker is the fact that it drips and ""splashes"" EVERY time I pour from the carafe to a cup.  It doesn't matter how tight the lid is - it ALWAYS leaks.  I have to clean the counter repeatedly to get rid of all the drips and ""splashes"".Bottom line, it makes a good pot of coffee that will taste fresh for hours, but it's very heavy and if you have any sort of elbow issues, pouring a cup of coffee is not only messy but painful!"
"Every time I pour a cup the carafe splatters coffee all over counter.  Finally stop using the carafe to fill the reservoir because of the mess and used a water pitcher.  I have used it for over a year and finally had enough cleaning up splatters and bought another brand.  It made fine coffee and was easy to use, however,  It amazes me how Cusinarts quality control let this get by!"
The coffee maker works well and the coffee is good but the carafe is not designed well. You have to turn it completely upside down to get the last of the coffee out and it splashes and spills everywhere. The carafe is hard to clean. The hole in the top is not big enough to get your hand in and even with turning it upside down all the liquid does not come out so you have to use a bottle brush or something to dry out the inside. For these reasons we hate it but we tossed the box so we can’t send it back for a refund.
"In the description it is said to be 12”. It is not, it is 14.5”. So now it will not fit under my cabinets.The main reason for buying this was that it would fit under the cabinets."
"We were so excited to get our new coffee maker.  We really tried to like it but just couldn't. The carafe is so heavy to try to pour out of especially if you have arthritic hands and are 75.  We had to order a special vesselused to water plants with a special spout  to pour the water in the pot so it did not go everywhere.  The coffee was not as good as our previous coffee maker, which, by the way, was less expensive.  So, sadly, it is on the "" to do something with"" shelf and we ordered the brand we had  before.  Our new, cheaper coffee pot arrived yesterday and this morning we enjoyed a great cup of coffee.  Lesson learned and money wasted."
"The Cuisinart DCC 1850 brews coffee just fine and easy to use, but there is a problem with the pour spout on the carafe. You have to be very careful not to dribble coffee on your counter or cup rim . My husband says it’s almost impossible to empty the pot completely, he has to be at the sink so it doesn’t make a mess .Sounds like the newer models have the same problem!"
"This coffee-maker was a disappointment.  First, although we are not devoted to super-hot coffee, the coffee quickly becomes too cool to enjoy, even for us.  Once the coffee is in the carafe, it is not heated.  If you preheat the carafe with boiling water before you make coffee, it stays warmer longer, but if you just make the coffee with a cold carafe, it becomes too cool to be palatable very quickly.  Boiling water, filling the carafe, and then making coffee is really not an acceptable solution, although it is better than making coffee in a cold carafe.  Second, there is no good way to measure the amount of water to put into the coffee maker just using the carafe and the machine.  With our last coffee-maker (and every other coffee-maker we have ever owned), the carafe was glass, so you could use the carafe to measure the water you wanted and pour it into the machine from the carafe.  Because this is a metal carafe, there is no way to know precisely how much water is in the carafe -- you need to use a separate measuring cup to fill the water reservoir.  And even if you want to make a full pot of coffee, you cannot just fill the carafe and pour it into the reservoir because of the temperature problem described above.  I guess you could fill the reservoir, then add boiling water from some other source to the carafe until it is preheated and then make coffee, but that would be a real hassle -- and waste a lot of water.  Third, I do not know why anyone would think that this is machine is easy to clean.  It is true that the basket and filter are relatively easy to remove and put in the dishwasher, but the carafe has proven to be impossible to clean completely.  We faithfully rinse the carafe after each use and then soak it for a few minutes with hot water and dishwashing soap.  The metal interior of the carafe has nevertheless become covered with coffee stains.  Because the neck of the carafe is smaller than most human hands, it is impossible to scrub the interior of the pot to remove the stains.  We have been using this coffee-maker for over a year and there is really no solution to any of these problems, so I think we will just toss this and start over with something that has a glass carafe and a heating element that keeps it warm after the coffee is made.  I do not understand how anyone could think that this is a good coffee-maker."
"I've had nothing but cheap Mr. Coffee type brands prior to this purchase, and been fine.  My last one's heating element died after 8 years of use. My fiance insisted we get a ""good"" brand this time & with the thermal carafe because he insists on his coffee causing burns inside his mouth. I hated to do it but I purchased this for $130 or something like that, and guess what, I hate it. Every poster is correct when saying the carafe is sooo poorly designed. Its very heavy even when empty, it pours incredibly slowly into your cup, and you can never get the last 1/4 cup out because of how the inside is designed. Also, you need to pull out your long handled scrub brush to clean inside, because not even a child's hand would fit thru the opening. The ""tone"" to alert you that brewing has finished awakens you as if the smoke alarm is going off (totally freaked us out the first few times, and still is very concerning). The carafe based on comments, did not keep the coffee as hot for as long as expected.  2 hours max and then you're using the microwave anyway. The gold tone filter allows ground coffee to leave a lot of residue floating thru, so you get thick coffee sludge in the last of your coffee cup.  Its a total disappointment for so much expense, and I waited too long so now I can't return it. I may actually have to give up coffee because of this stupid thing.  The only ""pro"" about this is the fact that your coffee doesn't taste cooked after 2 hours."
"My last coffeemakers have all had glass carafe-with-heat-plate designs. For some time I've thought about getting one with a thermal carafe, though, and chose this one when my last coffeemaker died. Setup is easy. I don't use the time brew feature so I don't know how well it works. Downside: Though the carafe keeps coffee hot for a long time, it  is poorly designed.It didn't take me but one pot to find I have to add nearly another cup if I wanted my usual 2-3 mugs because of the difficulty in emptying the carafe. The only way to get that last bit out is to hold it upside down. Literally. No way to pour it into a mug. I end up dumping a half cup or so down the sink each time. Not a big deal if you can afford the waste, but...And the lid opening is too small to permit easy cleaning. Too small for my hand, anyway. So far I rinse it with clean water, then drop a cloth or paper towel inside and use the handle of one of my spatulas or spoons to push it around.So why do I keep it? Though these issues are annoying they do not outweigh the convenience of having hot coffee throughout the day in a carafe that can be set on any surface (the outside of the carafe never gets hot). And I don't have to worry about breaking a glass carafe, or the danger of accidentally leaving the hot plate on. But when I have to replace this coffeemaker, I *will* pay special attention to the carafe!"
Coffee maker worked well for 14 months of daily use. Then it died.  Display lights up but does not respond to any button pushes.  Tried unplugging and plugging back in after about 30 minutes.  Didn't help.  Very disappointed.
"Was hard to pour the coffee out. The short, squat design & extra lip on the inside of the pot."
"I really wanted to like this coffee maker. I love the idea of an insulated pot (be aware that this one is quite heavy though) where the coffee stays hot without burning. I would say that the unit functions well and I like the features except for pouring the water it. The other reviewers were correct that it is a bit of a pain to pour into the fairly small water area, and I had to use a separate container to add the water, not the pot, which you do almost have to tip upside down to get the coffee out. The issue that made me return this maker was the TASTE. It was only OK - maybe even a bit acidic - and it is not my coffee or water quality. My old Ninja made a tasty brew with the very same coffee and water type, but it had a leak problem too early in its life, so I thought I would try this one. Perhaps the water runs through this maker too hot, but it was not tasty to us. Reluctantly, I'm back to Ninja. Sorry Cuisinart."
"Every since buying this coffeemaker in Nov. 2023, it has given me fits !ALMOST every time I pour from the carafe, it drips onto the tabletop or other surface the cup is on.I am NOT KIDDING when I say I have tried dozens of different approaches to pouring : slow, fast, high, low, different cups, lid on/off, gasket changes, etc.I have concluded there's a design flaw involving the carafe lid beyond my control.Given the high cost of replacement, I just keep a rag handy.Disgusted with this model !"
"The DCC-3400 is Cuisinart's newest model and, I guess, their effort to improve on the DCC-3200, which recently was CR's highest rated coffee maker.  I've had my 3400 for a week and here are my initial observations:First, it makes good coffee but larger quantities seem to taste better.  My wife likes two nominal cups of full-strength in the a.m. whereas I'm a decaf guy so I've been making two separate batches of 2-3 cups.  That coffee tastes fine but this a.m. I made 5 cups of brew and it definitely had a fuller aroma.Second, the insulated carafe (no more glass pot and hot plate) is a monster.  It keeps the coffee drinkably hot for several hours but it weighs 2 lbs. 4 oz. empty.  It's impossible to tell by hefting it how much coffee is left.  As other reviewers have noted, it's also almost impossible to pour out the last couple ounces from the carafe without removing the lid.Third, this machine is tall, 21 3/4 in. with the top open.  We have a ""coffee station"" in a kitchen cabinet and I had to raise the overhead shelf several notches to get sufficient clearance.Overall, I'm glad I bought this coffee maker but it's not perfect.  I evaluated a bunch of machines and believe this is the best available at the ~$100 price point.August 5, 2017 update.  Trying to get the last couple ounces out of the poorly designed carafe is a recurring pain in the posterior although the coffee does taste fresher longer than an open-top carafe.  Revise review to three stars.  Cuisinart could and should have done better."
"I’m sure this Cuisinart  will work well for some customers, unfortunately not me. The pot itself is very, very heavy, making it difficult to lift while pouring the water into the coffee maker, or even a cup. The mouth of the pot is too small to fit a hand in to clean. The cover of the pot is multi- layered, also difficult to clean and retains water/ coffee inside, so is never really clean. . I wish I had returned it. Not  the Cuisinart for me."
"We have had this coffee maker for several months and we have been frustrated by its inability to keep the coffee warm, even though all the reviews say it keeps it so hot. I reread the description on Amazon and it says 'auto-off functionality (0-4 hours), ""  This would make you think you can keep the plate  on/warm for up to 4 hours. However, this model does not have that ability, and if you go the Cuisinart website, you will see that  they do not list that function for this model. That is for a higher priced model. So, now it's too late to return it and I am upset that I didn't catch it sooner.  Now we have to buy another new machine, because it's literally lukewarm coffee within an hour.  Amazon, you need to adjust your description, it is misleading."
This does not keep the coffee warm long enough. Says it has adjustable auto off. It does not. It turns off as soon as it is done brewing. Thermal Carafe only keeps it hot for a couple of hours with out the option to turn the hot plate back on. Very disappointed. One thing I will say it does make a great tasting cup of coffee. If you want an auto off adjustable feature this is not right for you. Also way too expensive for what it claims. Very disappointed.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Unfortunately,  after less than a year I'm updating my review. The coffee pot quit brewing a whole pot, first leaving only a cup of water in the reservoir. I thought maybe it was just Calcium build up so I started empyring it daily and leaving it open to dry. I clean the carafe weekly and run scale remover through monthly. This morning it took a nose dive and will only brew one cup at a time before its alarming that it's done. There's still almost a whole ressevior full of water! This thing didn't even outlast any of my Walmart coffee makers. Disappointing.I have been looking and researching thermal carafe coffee makers for years. I constantly break glass carafes and sometimes have trouble finding new ones that would fit. I've been replacing coffee pots every year or less because of thr broken carafes, the leal, or stop working. I was hesitant to purchase a thermal because I worried the coffee would not be hot when my husband woke up two hours later. I tested this on the first run when the recommend you run a cycle of plain water. At two hours, the coffee was piping hot! At three hours, the coffee was still piping hot! You can see the steam rising from the carafe after I removed the lid. This unit does have a hot plate that I assume helps to warm the coffee during brewing. It is hot immediately after but cools down quickly after brewing is complete. The coffee tastes great! Way better than the Walmart coffee pots I've been buying. It's definitely a high end coffee pot and the taste and quality shows. Like previous users mention, it is a heavy carafe when full and you do have to tip it almost completely upside down to get that last cup out. In my opinion those are minor inconveniences. I've dealt with more annoying issues that actually affect the functionality from cheaper pots. If this thing continues to functionality as well as it is, I forsee it will outlast any of my other pots!"
"This is a great coffee maker for making coffee. It's honestly some of the best home brewed coffee I've had.It's horrible for serving that coffee. The carafe is a nightmare to use. Unless it's more than half full, you have to tilt it more than 90 degrees forward to get the coffee to pour. The further you tilt it, the more the coffee begins to splatter. If you use it to brew 2-4 cups, which is what we use five days a week, you have to turn it almost upside down to get coffee out. At first I though the carafe was broken until I really looked at the lid and figured out how it worked. Coffee has to reach almost the center of the lid to make it to the opening the feeds the spout.Except for the one, but significant defect, this makes delicious coffee and I'll keep using it even though it frustrates me every time I pour a cup."
"While the coffee maker is clearly built, well, the major issue is the carafe,  First, the lid has a pouring port that clearly needs to be redesigned, Since you have to tilt the carafe almost 90° before it starts pouring, and the poor is very weak.  Second, the inner gasket and lip to the top of the carafe traps water. When you clean the carafe and turn it upside down that water never drips out and drains. It takes a lot to finally dry the carafe in preparation for your next use. The features and functions are good, and the coffee is good, but let’s just say I would never buy a second one."
"I replaced my Keurig w/this Nespresso after having an espresso at my niece’s house.It will brew a 5oz or 8oz coffee, as well as, a single or double espresso depending on the pod you choose. The pods all look the same, but have a coding on top that the machine reads to brew the correct beverage. It is a very simple push of the button w/the bonus of kicking the pod out into the side container. This came with a complimentary variety of size/flavor sample pack pods. That was all wonderful!HOWEVER….I have few problems w/ this machine. First, only a select few of my coffee cups (especially travel) actually fit. But more annoying… I cannot find the pods in a local store. They have to be ordered through Nespresso & are steep in cost. Another pod caution… making sure you order the “Vertuo pod”.  I was searching for a new flavor & accidentally ordered pods that came in “original pod” which is a different size/shape rendering it useless w/ this machine. I usually order in plenty of time because sometimes arrival date is lengthy. By the time me I realized my mistake it was too late to return my $40 order. This was a serious issue! I needed my morning coffee & tried to be “creative…. Only creating a huge mess & an even grumpier morning!! *pay attention to pods ordered."
"The first Nespresso machine I purchased was complete with a package of 12 pods. Bought 2 more for Christmas gifts and both were shipped without the pods. There is a space in the packaging for the pods, but they were not packaged or they have been removed."
Today the machine broke down.  It started to leak water and stopped pouring coffee.  Instead I bought Nespresso Original line machine.Pros:Quick way to get an a cup of coffee.Cons:Pods are very expensive.  It adds up over time.Vertuo line does not have many other producers like Original.  Thus the choices are limited.  I tried a number of different pods and I can not say they have great coffee.
"I like the machine, however, there needs to be a light to display the wanted tank is low or needs to add water! I messed up two pods and thought the machine was broken until I realized I needed to refil the water tank."
"Machine didn't work at first.  I needed to call Nespresso technical support.  They were able to get it to work.  The coffee sample pack I received today in October was expired as of January of this year!  What a waste.  I tried contacting Amazon customer support, but couldn't talk with a real person and the voice I was trying to talk to did not understand.  Very frustrating.  The old coffee does not taste good."
"I had to order this machine twice to have the right one arrive, the first time there was no frother included. I read reviews after this happened and it seems to happen a lot. Kind of a pain to repack return and reorder. Excited to use the machine everyday. I have this same machine at work and love the coffee it makes."
"It says in description and on the box as well that there are 12 complimentary capsules. But nope , nothing. Disappointed"
Just received this today 8/3/24Free gift of 12 pods are expired.Going through the channels trying to get this resolved. Messaged Nespresso as Breville does not list this as a product for registration.Must be old stock? Unit works fine but shouldn’t beoffering a free set if it’s expired.“UPDATE” Nespresso reached out to me. They were very helpful. Shipped out a new set to me and it’s arriving today! Amazon may want to notify previous buyers and check the boxes they have in stock so this does not happen again.
"I had experienced the Nespresso machine at a friends and loved it but I am extremely disappointed in the one we bought and I'm not sure what the difference is but I would return it if I could.  the positive is that is extremely attractive and compact and I like the look over the Keurig brand.  It's also very easy to use.  However those features are the only positives for me.  Right off the bat, the coffee never came out hot.  I immediately had to put the coffee in the microwave for 20 seconds to have a hot cup of coffee.  Next, I'm not in love with all the foam.  I knew from reading about the machine that there would be foam but never expected it to take up 1/3 of the cup.  I could hardly get to the coffee so I would have to dump a bunch of the foam out just to be able to sip the coffee.  My husband is a cappuccino lover so the foam was not as much of a problem to him but he did agree it was more than he would prefer.  the last disappointment or difficulty relates to the Nespresso coffee selections.  I love a flavorful dark roast or even medium to dark roast coffee...Sumatra, French roast, Columbian, Kona, Costa Rican, Jamaican, Starbucks Cafe Vienna etc.  The coffee selections offered under the Nespresso name are so strong we both could not enjoy them.  Even adding water which usually works with stronger coffees, did not help our enjoyment of the coffee.  they all had a bitter edge or finish.  I am about to order Starbucks coffee for Nespresso and hope that will be more satisfying.  We called Nespresso and complained.  They suggested to heat the water before pouring in the carafe which helped ever so slightly but not enough to give us a really hot cup of coffee.  we always heat the mug first but nothing really helps."
The Nespresso machine works great.  The milk frother stopped working after ONE month.  Very disappointing!!  Have followed the instructions and the tips on troubleshooting. Will have to buy a different brand of frothing apparatus.
"So I ordered this during. A Memorial Day sale, I purchased one with steamer, but it did not come w the steamer.  Unfortunately, I needed a coffee maker at the office, and the only option was to do a complete return, but I would no longer receive the discounted rate.  I searched the internet, and the deal I received was still cheaper than other sites, so I decided to keep it with out the steamer.I took off two starts because with out the steamer, that means I received half of the product."
"The machine itself is fine, but there was supposed to be some espresso capsules together with the machine missing in the box, the box itself looks shabby, definitely open boxed and returned product. Overall I don’t mind a return one being sold with the price for a new machine, but amz should have check the condition of the return package."
"First impression:The package was rather large but once unpacked and sat on a counter the machine is not much bigger than a regular pod coffee machine. I love the taste of coffee and espresso that this machine creates, but I wish I would have known that you can ONLY use this with pods bought from the Nespresso website and amazon. I decided to give this machine a try and it’s great! Love that it comes with a variety of pods to test taste! In my opinion buying without the frother is the most cost effective and you can purchase the system for under 100 with a sale.Pros:Compact, great design, easy to refill. Creates coffee house quality coffee and espresso. The machine alone is beautiful for the countertop. I would strongly recommend this product if you are someone who buys coffee at a shop everyday. Although the pods range from .85-1.20 each, in the long run you’ll save money. The quality is superior to other machines and pod systems that I have used.Cons:Pods exclusively available on Nespresso .com or amazon. They are expensive, and can’t be reused. Also, you’ll have to buy a seperate milk frother, but they are cheap at big box retailers.Update 2019:This item is no longer in use. I should have known that much like other pod systems that they eventually lose their flavor. I have moved onto other coffee machines that I now consider superior. The thing that drove me away from this item was the lack of stock on amazon for the pods, and also the expense of buying the pods off the website. Some retailers on amazon were driving up the prices for the pods and also nespresso suddenly was more expensive than me going to Starbucks! So now this has been donated- it was good while it lasted."
"when i got my machine, it had already been opened. it was missing all of the paperwork to register the item, as well as the welcome package that has coffee that you can try and the sample the coffee they sell and you will have the ability to use the machine as well. i contacted the Nespresso company, since it had not been bought from them, the only availability I had was to buy new coffee to sample. I would appreciate if I could be reimbursed with a similar option. I do understand if it is not accepted. I respect your decision. there is only one other problem I have had the entire time I have been ordering from your company. I have been an RN since 1985, and ""BOY"", we get slammed sometimes for a lot but sometimes just for people to need a ""dog"" to kick around...Sincerely,your understanding customer. Ginger Brannan, BSRN ALABAMA"
"It took about 2 hours of troubleshooting to get it working!! I had the same issue others did, machine turns on, you can hear the pump start, but no water.... Finally got it working, made a caramel macchiato, tasted delicious. Now for the true test, I'm hoping this one doesn't leak like the VertuoPlus did. I'd wake up every morning to a puddle of water underneath that one.I'm excited to use it again, but I'm disappointed that it took so much work to get it up & going. When you spend that much money, it should work right out of the box."
"I generally do not write reviews but I am doing so in hopes that it will save someone else $200. I have had this exact model Nespresso Machine for 6 years and have been happy with it up until it stopped working recently. I bought a new one and immediately upon use the coffee tasted bitter and burnt. I know that this is not the way it is meant to taste after having used other family members machines and my own of course in the past. I have tried MANY times to get ahold of someone in customer service and no one answers the phone. I used the customer chat option and they directed to the same customer service line. So I sent an email and got an auto response to call the same customer service line. I then used the chat option again and they told me they would send a message to customer service to call me and this was several days ago and I have not been contacted. Within this week, the machine started sounding like a helicopter trying to take off and it is incredibly loud and this is also not typical. Regardless, DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! I would give stars if I could."
"Listed as getting machine and milk frother, only received the main machine."
Love this machine at my work but my order came without frother (it’s a must!) and I returned and they sent another one again without frother! So beware of ordering with frother you might not receive it and it’s not cheap.
Product was superior just didn’t like the consistency of the drink! The restock fee was a little outrageous! If I’d know that I would have kept it!
"The milk frother worked properly for the first 3 uses and is now useless. I have contacted them regarding this issue, I have shown them the problem through video and they have used every excuse to not replace it even though it’s under warranty. I was first told to only use fresh milk which I always have, then I was told to only use whole milk and it still doesn’t make a good froth. The Expresso machine itself works well but I’m unsure what it’s going to take to get the (aerator) frother replaced."
"At six months, I had to send the unit back to Nespresso who serviced it and sent it back. The flow rate was never correct, even though I did daily and weekly cleanings. Needless to say right now, it is just a paperweight. Plus the cost of the pods are astronomical even if you go with the refill your own and rebuild they just don’t work as well. Not a super big fan of this product."
"Had been eyeing this for a while and finally broke down and bought it just after Christmas.  Missed the boat on a lower price during Christmas but after what I paid in Starbucks during December, I figured it would be worth it.  Good: very easy to use, clean and brews a cup pretty quickly.  Bad: NOT HOT-coffee comes out warm.  I did read thru some reviews which recommended brewing an old pod to warm up the machine (which it will do) but still not hot enough. esp if you are adding cream.  Would've been great if it came with some sort of ""primer"" you could use to warm it up.  It does come with a milk frother but there were 0 instructions on how to use it.  Also I was hoping to warm milk without froth but it  does not allow for that.  Took out the frothing attachment but then it doesn't function.  Finally the pods are pricey as hell.  Anywhere from $1.20 to $1.50 for the 7.7 ounces.  Espresso and smaller are incrementally less expensive but of course you get less coffee.  I am  going to try one of the reusable kits for the pods but seems like a big pain in the butt when I was looking for ease.  all in all a lot to pay for this machine, would feel  better if it was $100 less and pods were a bit  less too-imho."
First one we bought came in perfect condition. We bought a second one during Ciber Monday. We just opened it up and realized that the water reservoir was damaged. I know it’s been a long time since we received the item (our mistake). I talked to a Nespresso representative and the only thing we can do is to buy a replacement.
"Updated 11/2024It actually busted on me within a 14 months. Too expensive of a product to only last this long. This was a 5-star review, now 3 star. Coffee was  great, but crazy that it lasted so little time.I got hooked on Starbucks delivery when I sustained a back injury. Two coffees, a danish, and a $5 tip made this a 25$ a day habit. I did some research and came across this machine. It’s amazing - the coffees are just as good, maybe better, than the Starbucks ones.I really like that the little pods are recyclable. What’s amazing too is that the size of the pod automatically gives you the right amount of water. Example: I love the double espresso, and it comes out perfect each time. Put a regular pod in, and it fills the cup. Add a pod that generally would expect some milk, and the mug will be 3/4 full. My purchase also came with the frother which is simply amazing!  Very happy overall. I’m saving a lot of money now too !!!"
Welcome set of coffee did not come with machine as it says in description and on the box
I did not receive the complimentary starter set of nespresso capsules that is supposed to be included with my purchase. I reached out to the seller and did not receive a response back.
"I’d like to start by saying I never leave bad reviews. I’ve had to replace items through Amazon before and it doesn’t bother me. This item is awful! I bought it for my husband for his birthday. We went to make coffee today (his b-day was yesterday) and it wouldn’t even suction the water at all. After two hours of Googling and YouTube videos we let it sit for a while. We went back and tried everything all over again. None of the suggestions worked (and we tried them all). A different comment mentioned their coffee was expired. I went to check ours and sure enough it’s about 18 months past the expiration date. My guess is this machine has been sitting in a hot warehouse and has an airlock that just won’t budge. Sending it back. Not sure which model to buy now. The more im reading, the more common this seems to be."
New nespresso user from Keurig. Coffee is good but so difficult to find affordable coffee in the right size or flavor. Way too many choices and it’s very confusing. The machine is very loud and takes a very long time to brew. None of my coffee cups fit on the holder and almost tip over every single time. Coffee is not hot at all. No matter what you do.
"I really wanted to love this machine because the coffee flavor is amazing. As a former Keurig user I have to admit that the quality of the coffee from Nespresso is superior. When I use my Keurig I normally have to wait a while before I can drink my brew because is extremely hot. The coffee I get from this Nespresso Vertuo machine is warm as best. I have to put my cup of coffee in the microwave for at least 15 seconds so I can drink it hot. In summary, I'm keeping this machine but is not getting five stars from me."
"While the machine in terms of design and quality is amazing, what I got delivered after a delay left me in shock. The machine had been used before, it was dirty, as shown in the picture, and the whisk was missing. It only got worse. The water tank wouldn't seal when removed from the machine, and it would spill water everywhere. And on top of all, the machine didn't work. Absolute terrible experience."
"If you’re trying to purchase the machine + frother bundle, like I did, you will only receive the machine. Don’t get me wrong the nespresso is great, so far the coffee is delicious, however you won’t receive the frother part of your order. No matter how many customer service members you talk to. You’ll end up stuck having to return multiple machines like myself and told just to purchase it elsewhere. 🤦🏼‍♀️ 5 stars for nespresso 0 stars for Amazon!"
Why didn’t the 12 pack start kit com with my machine when it says so in the description ?
"Bought this as a gift for my husband. Disappointed, as the milk frother was missing"
I've only had this machine for a month and have used the Aeroccino Milk Frother  less than a dozen times and it no longer works. It will heat the milk up but no longer produces any foam. For as much money as Nespresso costs I'd expect it to last longer than a month! Really disappointed
"20180906, wms: It's OK, but not amazing. The unit is noisy when it makes coffee, so much so that conversation is difficult. I've been using it about two weeks now, and it seems to have gotten noisier. It seems to really labor to pump out a cup of coffee.Overall, the coffee is fine, although very expensive. As compared to a K-cup (about 50¢) the Nespresso pods run about twice as much (about $1.10).This Nespresso unit uses the larger pods, of which there are 3 sizes. Everything is in pseudo-Italian, so it isn't always easy to figure out what's what. It would be nice if the just labeled these things small, medium, and large, and put English names for the coffee. Most of it you can figure out, but why make the consumer work so hard? Just call the Diavolitto ""Little Devil"" and move on.  Nespresso VertuoLine Espresso, Diavolitto, 50 Count        The milk frother works well enough, and very quiet. It has two settings, one for if the milk is cold (not sure why it wouldn't be). It makes a nice froth, and shuts off automagically. N.B. clean it right away. I rinse it and then add water and run another cycle, it cleans itself.The pods are printed with the names of the coffee in very low contrast, so you have to look carefully or learn the colors.As for the sizes, I've only ever found the small and medium on Amazon. No idea where to get the large ones.If anything changes, I will add an update to this review."
Disappointment - old merchandise & expired coffee
"I ordered a Nespresso machine a few days ago and received it last Saturday 11/24/2024.After reading the manual, I brewed coffee yesterday morning, but it wasn’t hot just a little warmer than lukewarm.I thought it was because it was the first time, so I brewed it again this morning and the coffee still the same which is a bit warmer than lukewarm.I’m wondering if the seller sent me a returned item.I’m really disappointed.Hopefully the seller will send me a different NEW item."
I bought this Nespresso machine after using machines in hotels and family members’ houses.  I enjoyed the coffee so I purchased this machine on Amazon.  I followed the instructions and cleaned the machine. The coffee is not drinkable and my machine emits a skunk like smell.  I have tried cleaning again and descaling the machine in spite of not having the machine long enough to make this necessary.  Houseguests have visited (some who have Nespresso machines) who confirm that something is not right with my machine.  I have tried 10-15 different pod flavors to make sure that it isn’t a certain type of coffee that is the problem.  I called Breville who had me take all of the steps that I had already taken.  They had me take a video while on the phone with them to make sure I was completing all of the steps accurately.  They walked me through a factory reset which I did.  Then they had me make a cup of coffee and taste it again.  It tasted exactly the same.  It tastes bad and something is wrong and different than other machines.  The Breville rep was completely unhelpful and said that the coffee was supposed to taste bitter.  When I asked if there was any resolution available like a new (properly functioning) machine or refund she stated that there was no recourse available.  I am extremely frustrated as now I am left with an expensive machine that doesn’t brew properly and no further guidance from Breville.  Can not recommend this purchase to anyone.
"This machine is beautiful and makes a nice cup of coffee or espresso HOWEVER, I ended up buying both this model and the De’Longhi model and can really see some differences in the two.I ordered the Breville model for my home and the De’Longhi model for my store’s break room area and though the coffee taste is great on both machines, the temperature of the Breville is just always luke-warm. This reason alone, I would suggest the De’Longhi model.ALSO, I ordered this by selecting “machine with frother” and only the machine arrived. I went through the instructions to try and get the frother delivered but the best they could do was send me a $35 gift card instead. I was fine with this solution but be aware that you may only receive the machine if you’re expecting both."
No frother...I want my frother.
"I was super excited for this machine to give as a gift to my husband. Unfortunately, the machine didn't work. The water mechanism had an issue that it wouldn't pull water through. We attempted to troubleshoot and resolve the issue to no avail. Both Amazon and Nespresso were helpful. I am returning this and trying again with a different Nespresso Model."
"Giving 3 stars because it’s incredibly loud, and I don’t taste a difference in the coffee really. So got this because out of all the models they have. I have read this one has the least issues than the other models.  Other reviews said this is quiet. Well mine, maybe I have a lemon?? But it is incredibly loud! Way more loud than a Keurig.  I have already returned a different one because they sent me the wrong machine. So frustrated because I’m torn with do I return this in hopes I get one that you can’t hear thru the entire house and have it sound like it’s in every room brewing???"
"UPDATE: Had product little over 2 months,now producing lukewarm coffee. Called Amazon, no longer under their warranty, referred to manufacturer. The customer rep was unfriendly but agreed to send a box & label to return & have the thermo regulator fixed or unit replaced. He knew right away so must be a widespread problem. No sense of humor when I asked if I get free coffee since I won't have the unit for awhile. He flatly said no. Giving it 2 stars to be fair since they will replace but wondering how soon until this happens again. Love it! I've had this almost two months & besides the welcome pack of a variety of coffee pods, I've ordered from Negspresso 2 times. It's the favorite part of my day, having a great cup of espresso or coffee with really good froth. What surprised me is that I love the decaf as much as the other kinds. This is great if you want an afternoon coffee without all of the caffeine. Macine works great, is easy to clean- if you press it 3 times it runs through a self clean cycle. I appreciated the variety pack that came with the machine when first ordering & took the time to rate each one as I tried it, so I would know what to reorder. The only downside is that you can't get any pods currently at Target or any local store but have to order from the US company. They do ship quickly, but you have to think ahead. I'm a person that cares about the environment & appreciate that, upon request, they send you a UPS bag for recycling, free of charge. You just have to bring it in to a UPS store. The pods are so colorful & artistic that I have them displayed in a silver bowl next to my Negspresso machine. I love my espresso, Gran Lugo & coffee so much more now & I don't have to go to a coffee shop to get a quality cup."
"Purchased several of these, on Amazon as well as direct from manufacturer. One was returned for plastic chemical in the water tank that made water taste nasty(a problem they admitted to). Another lasted only months before breaking and another that makes terrible tasting coffee. Will not purchase any more!"
"i requested this machine as a holiday gift. I give it 5/5 stars for the fun and excitement factor. It feels super luxe and the pods are beautiful and flavorful. However, for everyday use I'm not sure this is the brewing system for me. The thing is, the coffee the machine brews is just not hot enough if you take your coffee with milk. There ARE a few solutions:  you can rinse your mug under hot water, or steam the milk with the aeroccino (which I often do), or preheat the machine (which I haven't tried). If you froth the milk, you will get a lovely, aromatic, warm cup of coffee. It's a nice luxury. However, at this price point, I don't appreciate the extra step for a machine that promises I high level of automation. I also can't understate the fact that the pods are expensive and the costs quickly add up, at >$1, this may not be the right option for someone who wants to enjoy coffee as a regular treat, not a special indulgence. In addition, the pods are not too easy to source. There are a few options on amazon, but for the full selection you need to go a nespresso boutique or pay for shipping on their website (unless you order a large quantity of pods). Full disclosure, I will continue to use this machine for busier mornings and afternoon treats."
"I was excited to get this machine as I’ve enjoyed Nespresso originals. I’m an experienced Keurig AND Nespresso user.  The first machine arrived and was clearly at least an “open box” item if not refurbished, despite that I paid for brand new.  The box had been TAPED CLOSED so I took pictures in case Amazon questioned me later.  The promotional paperwork inside was all marked up, and the styrofoam had already been broken.  Then of course the machine didn’t work—apparently couldn’t pull in any water.  Returned no questions asked and got a replacement within a few days that looked brand new, finally.  BUT AGAIN the machine couldn’t pull in any water—I tried everything regarding troubleshooting, but nothing worked.  Returning this second one too and am extremely disappointed.  Have now ordered the Pop+ and am hoping it works; fingers crossed."
Priming the water pump required a tube that fit in the water tank receiver and forcing water into the pump. Water temp was not hot enough coffee was weak. We bought it because a friends worked great. Our did not. Returned.
"I have owned one of these appliances for 5 months.  I feel it is time to write my review.  This product is a very nice appliance.  There are 2 items one should consider before buying this appliance.  Our family uses about 6 pods per day.  First, the cost for the coffee pods quickly add up.  In a weeks time we use 30 pods.  That equates to $35.00/week.  One can considered refilling the pods but the time required And the mess involved may not be worth the hassle. There are videos on YouTube on how to do this.  Also the time to re-order new capsules and have them delivered has cost our family mornings without our java.My solution to this is to look for an expresso machine that grinds your beans to your liking and sizes up a cup to your liking.If you consider $35.00 times 5 equals $175.00 a month for your pods, in three months time you can buy a state of the art expresso machine and enjoy that fresh brew every morning. That is exactly what I did.From a cost perspective I would not recommend this product"
"I purchased this machine I think it’s find machine if you’re used to using a Keurig. I was not really excited about the separate milk frother but as far as making a quick espresso shot or coffee on the go, it was great."
"Makes a much larger cup of coffee than I expected (I owned the original Nespresso machine for many years) so I had to get a bigger mug. Anyway, short story short, it was delivered at the beginning of December and worked fine until today. Now it refuses to switch on. Yes, I've tried it in other sockets and yes, I reset the fuse etc. even though it didn't need to be reset because all my other appliances work fine. I clicked on the BrevilleSupport link on Amazon but the page returns a Code 503 error, so I guess I'll have to call them when they open in a few hours..."
"I used to own the previous Nespresso model with standard capsule until it broke. Love it! When I looked for a replacement, I thought the line will be soon discontinued and mostly moved to new Vertuo and larger capsules line, so I got this one. Here are some key differences you should be aware of: 1) the flavor is not espresso, but feels more like pressed coffee. More American taste than European. 2) there is no way to control quantity brewed, just one button that adjust based on capsule size.  3) No ability to stop in middle or get just hot water (without capsule inserted) 4) the large capsules are taking too much space in the drawer (and in recycling bag)! 5) Way too much foam per cup, in my taste."
"We had one of these at our office at work and I decided to get one as well.  However, I received mine and it would not pump water through and was very loud.  I did not even get to use it.  Ideally I would like it replaced, but that option was not available.  I would have to have refund issued and purchase another one.  Unfortunately, it would take another week.  I ended up buying another brand instead."
Pieces were broken and unable to load pods
"I already had the original line machine, which I love, but I wanted to make regular coffee, so I bought this machine. I do like it, but the “crema” from the pods that fit this machine is too thick and is more of a foam than a cream. The “crema” with the pods for the original line is just right. I noticed since using this, my breath is often bad and my tongue is usually coated.I really like the pods for gran lungo. The pods for regular coffee are hit and miss."
"I’m upset, I didn’t pay a $1dollar for this Nespresso, I expected better quality than what I received.  Why do you sell as new if it’s not, this is a scam. Very disappointed… Don’t buy from this seller .. Deserves No star"
I am disappointed with the temperature of the coffee. It  is only 60 C (140 F).  I did preheat the coffee mug in a microwave for 45 seconds followed by rinsing the inside of the cup with boiling water.  Only after doing that did I collect the coffee coming out of the Nespresso machine.  I used a Dip thermometer (food grade) into the coffee and kept it there for sufficient duration.  The maximum temperature it recorded was only 60 C (140 F).  I am quite disappointed with this.  I am considering returning the unit and asking for a replacement.
"I had the original Nespresso single serve machines that used the smaller pods that came in a variety of brands and flavors. I loved that machine, but it was old and eventually crapped out on me. So when I bought the Vertuo machine - I leaned far too much on the sleek design. The two large drawbacks and why I would NOT recommend this machine is that you are limited in pod choice and the mug footprint only likes certain size mugs so it can spill if you dont' supervise your pour. I will go back to a machine that has more flavor varieties with superior coffee."
"Overall the espresso maker works great I don’t have any issues with it, the only thing that I have an issue with is the electric milk frother. At first, the frother worked great but it started to go downhill approaching the one year mark. I have had the product for about a year and the frother is already not working properly. I’m not sure if it’s a battery or something I need to replace but it doesn’t make cold foam at all. Before it would work within a minute or two, now it takes nearly 15 minutes even at that it’s still not ready and still very liquidy, it’s also incredibly slow and at some times it doesn’t move at all. Save yourself money and don’t buy the frother just buy the espresso machine."
Be careful ordering the bundle - I received only the machine and not the milk frother with it. Ordered during Cyber Monday 2023.
"The first one we bought lasted a year and then crapped out. Amazon won’t warranty it. Bought a second one, it didn’t work right out of the box. Sending this one back, too."
"I drink decaf, Nespresso's current selection is extremely limited 1 choice in the 7.8 oz cup and it does not have good flavor.  Choices for coffee are extremely limited. And I sure wish I could have like a 12 ounce cup of coffee. Maybe this machine is better for people who drink espresso. I wasted my money unless they come out with some new coffee.  If you want to recycle their pods, you're expected to mail them. You can make your own pods but it totally defeats the purpose of easy and efficient, which was what I was looking for. It would be really nice if there were more options. I feel I wasted my money and regret buying this expense coffee pot. So not worth it!"
"This is a good product, but just recently I started using my old coffee pot.  Call me old fashion, but I miss the smell of coffee in the morning.  Also, there is no indicator on the machine that it is low on water.... the machine was 'brewing' the coffee without water.  I thought the coffee was done, when I looked inside my cup, just foam.... then I realized there was no water in the machine."
"Had this machine for ~13 months.PROS:- great aroma and taste- easy to useCONS:- doesn’t brew hot enough beverage- aerocino does not froth non-dairy milk- wide/bulky compared to other brand’s modelsI don’t eat/drink dairy, so I used almond milk in the Aerocino. It frothed well for a few months, then one day it just stopped frothing (would just warm up almond milk and no frothing). I called customer service within the warranty period and they told me the Aerocino is not supposed to froth non-dairy milk. Wish I would’ve known before purchasing, otherwise I wouldn’t have bought the combo.A month after the one year warranty expired, a power surge in my apartment blew out my Nespresso and it stopped working. Somehow, my $30 microwave survived, so...what’s up with that, Breville?I ended up replacing my machine with the DeLonghi VertuoPlus model, and my new machine brews at much hotter temps (which I prefer), and is also sleek and more compact. Better all around. Sorry, Breville!"
"Many products can be reviewed as stand alone.  However some, such as printers and printer cartridges, razors and razor blades, and coffee machines and coffee capsules cannot by reviewed independently because they are entirely dependent on one another.  In fact when the consumer spends 95% of their money on the product that goes with the machine (coffee capsules) as opposed to the machine itself, it is essential in the review of a machine to comment on the parts that are required to operate it, in this case Nespresso's proprietary coffee.  In this case Nespresso ships a machine with a catalog of all their available coffee, but then fails to reliably offer a way to receive this coffee, causing a bait and switch of over-promising what you can get from this machine.Trustpilot shows 1.6 out of 5 stars on Nespresso for this exact problem.  Deliver-it's yelp reviews (the company that often delivers Nespresso capsules) are as low as possible (1 star).  Sitejabber confirms 2 out of 5 stars.  Reddit is filled with consistent nightmares.  Namely folks have a hard time sourcing the very product that you are required to purchase in order to use this machine (nespresso coffee capsules).  It is quite important that anyone buying this machine is aware that it is very difficult to use for the primary reason that the bulk of the internet is presently complaining that you cannot source Nespresso capsules reliably or quickly.  People need to know about the company's extremely low reputation score before buying this machine how painful it is to be able to enjoy it."
This is an initial review of what we have discovered after 3 days of use. In running water through the machine with cold filtered water temp would not go past 130 f. Added heated water at 165 f and output was 150 f. This was after 30 minutes of use. Was very disappointed with the temp output. Tried with a coffee pack and temp increased to 165 within minutes later. Not sure if the machine read bar code at this point and increased the temp. The temp on day 3 is still a little low for me at 180 f. However spouse is okay with this. The unknown for me and will explore this weekend is leaving the machine connected to a power source when not using. Ease of use has been very good. At this point on recommending a buy I am still not sure. This is based on temp output only. I do not see a way to increase the temp.
"the box and the description clearly states it comes with 12 welcome capsules, however, I did not receive these in my package. also, I purchased the milk frother and that did not come included as well."
"As many others have mentioned already below, I too received this product in what appeared to be a previously opened and resealed (packaging tape) box.After opening, we also noticed the included Nespresso pods were expired. Yuck.To make matters worse, we plugged in the unit and followed the instructions but it would not siphon the water from the reservoir. Defective!We promptly packed it back up and sent it back for a refund."
"As previous reviews had warned, the temperature of coffee is warm so when I add cream, it is not hot enough for me. It needed to be rewarmed in microwave which made the taste of the coffee not as good. I was very disappointed as I had thought the makers would have fixed this issue by now. I called Nespresso and spoke with customer service. I spoke to a very nice lady who told me I needed to do a daily maintenance of running the machine through with water first without coffee to heat the system up, but this means I have to fill the reservoir 2/3 full with water so that wastes a lot of water and the process takes at least 10 min even before having any coffee which defeats the purpose of having a coffee machine! I returned this with great disappointment. I am surprised by all the high reviews. This is NOT worth the price. I am back to making coffee in my coffee press."
"Purchased February 2021 and now, April 1, 2021 my aeroccino 3 has stopped working. If you decide this is the machine you want, I would purchase the machine only and then get a different frothed/steamer so you’re not spending money on a aeroccino that will break a couple months later.The machine is super easy to use and the coffee selection is amazing. Great for those who love coffees and lattes because this machine makes real espresso drinks along with basic coffee.Nespresso recycles your used pods! If you’re into saving the planet this is the machine you want because you are given a pre-paid mailer so that once you start dumping the pods,  you instead dump them in the pre-paid mailer and it gets sent to Nespresso so they can dispose and recycle the pods."
"Upon arrival this product was amazing. Coffee was rich and bold, was insanely easy to use. The frother exceeded expectations and had been great as well. I have had the product for around 2 months now. I don't use it as much as I had upon obtaining it as the quality has decreased rapidly. I have barely made it out of the variety pack that comes with the product and already more than half of my cup is foam rather than coffee. Having to scoop out nearly half the cup. I have followed the maintenance instructions with the frother, but it no longer froths anything. It heats up. The magnetic piece spins and steam rises through, but no froth. Just hot cream.Maybe it's just me and there is some maintenance step I am missing.I have ran the coffee machine through the cleaning cycle once a week just to be safe, so not sure why this is happening."
Paid for machine + milk frother only to not receive the frother. Disappointing
"This coffee maker is sleek and smaller size than my last coffee machine. I dislike not being able to get hot water when I need it for tea or soup.I bought this and donated my Keurig, wish I hadn’t.The espresso pods are so fancy probably only reason I bought it maybe I’ll buy nxt one that does brew hot water when needed without having to use cleaning mode to get some 🙄"
"This machine makes the most perfect tasting coffee/expresso I ever tasted!  Now the bad.If your someone that doesn’t use creamer you will absolutely love it but if your like me and use creamer the coffee will immediately be cold. Therefore you have to heat it up in the microwave afterwards which defeats the purpose.  The coffee just isn’t hot enough to begin with as I read in a lot of the comments for I bought, sadly I’ll be returning"
"Had been using the fantastic Bosch Tassimo coffee brewer who pioneered capsule brewing with barcodes for perfect brewing 15 years ago. Unfortunately after 10 year of heavy use it failed. Tried to find on Amazon but they do not sell them anymore, you now have to order from Europe. Nespresso to their credit copied the Bosch system but if falls short in brewing temperature (too cold) and every capsule I have tried has an annoying coffee scum on top. They must add milk solids to the coffee. With the Bosch the scum was an option. Still far better then the K cup system. Would recommend if you cannot find Bosch Tassimo."
"So I was already hesitant about getting a pod tye coffee machine so I wanted to go with the best. Higher end. More expensive. Etc. I got the first one, it was sent in a new box within an Amazon box. It had all the wrapping, paperwork, even came with coffee....but when I hooked it up, water NEVER CAME OUT. Ever. Just made this awful sound. I tried everything. Then amazon offered a replacement without needing to return the defective one. I thought for sure I wouldn't get another defective one. I bought coffee for it after all and really wanted this for my FIL since he has a hard time with his disabilities. 2nd one arrive and it was CLEARLY a used, item missing many items. Plugged it in and tried to do the first run to clean and omg it sounds better? I was hopeful.. but NOOOO WATER. I returned this one so fast. I was furious. Almost $200!! For a piece of vibrating defective plastic that shakes the whole counter. Nespresso are you kidding me. Horrible experience. Amazon even gave me a free gift card because this was so awful."
"TERRIBLE PRODUCT AND EVEN WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE- Nespresso does NOT back their products.  I bought this for a house where we go part-time.  Coffee was cold, tasteless...I read suggestions, cleaned, descaled many times and wasted ENDLESS $$ pods to try to get a decent cup of coffee.  Bought a french press instead since it was just a waste of pods.  Called support and they did a video chat that showed the machine was not functioning.  Once confirmed that their product was faulty, they offered me a discount on a new machine or I could pay $65 to repair it.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I told them that was unacceptable and asked to speak to a Supervisor...after an hour on hold and the agent repeatedly trying to get rid of me, I agreed to a call back, still no call back, no support.  I have bought Nespresso products for a decade but clearly they now cut corners on the quality of their machines and customer support.  I suspect half of these reviews were fake bc the coffee tastes like cold dirt.  Unacceptable when there are so many brands.  Do better, Nespresso"
"I want to come out first and say that the product is great, however I purchased the Nesspresso Vertuo AND MILK FROTHER combo. Which arrived buy without the milk frother. I called Amazon and they said it was a manufacture issue so I called Nesspresso and they said I would need to call Amazon. Amazon said they could replace the whole thing but now I have to return it in the box, which I know longer have, but that’s not the issue. I use Amazon because I’m lazy and am trying to get a product with minimal effort and as little, leaving of my house as possible. Now I have to do a whole return process. So I am just going to Target to purchase it and get it done. I am aware that product is Great, but any transaction where I’m out an extra (almost) $100, you are getting one star from me."
"I’m giving it three stars for several reasons. 1) I ordered new and when it came there was a slip at the top of the box that stated it’s refurbished. It seems new, but I wanted a new one that’s never been used, or out of the box. 2) the aerator spills over every time even if it’s not filled to the max, or using non-dairy milk such as almond milk. The foam also will not pour out with the rest of the milk. You have to use a spoon to coax it out.Pros: Very easy to use and clean, looks great on the counter top, and I like the container where the empty capsules dispense into. As far as the taste, I think it’s okay. At first it was amazing, but as time went on it started to taste bitter. Maybe it needs to be cleaned already. It’s only been 10 days or so and I usually make only one cup a day."
"I bought this as a gift for someone.  When they received it, the recipient went to brew the water through it before the initial use as instructed.  It was making a horrendously loud noise. I have one myself, and the noise this machine was making was not normal. My friend called the company, and they were first told that was normal, which it was not. Then It wouldn't brew the water at all.  The person in customer service kept telling her to keep trying over and over. The machine ended up getting overheated, and would not work at all after that.  The recipient told her she thought doing this repeatedly would probably burn out the motor, but this person kept telling her to do this again and again.  When the person in customer service finally agreed the machine was defective, they would NOT send a new one. She said they would take it back, but they only repair it, and send it back to her.  These machines are not cheap.  If I pay over $200.00 for something, I'd expect a full refund or a replacement on the machine.  This is not good business practice, and it's embarrassing because it was a gift."
"The only good thing about this coffee machine package is the Milk Frother.So after buying this machine, signing up with Nespresso's ""club"" and buying their expensive ""welcome Package"" , thinking there must be a flavor there that my wife and I would like, I ended up returning it because it for a replacement because I thought it was faulty and did not make hot coffee; but just warm, even after pre-warming the cup as recommended by filling the cup with hot water prior to brewing, and heating the milk in the frother.The second machine did exactly the same; made just warm coffee. Not only that, this one leaked from the top every time I made a cup. So I returned this one also, after figuring the idea is good, but the implementation just doesn't work. And thanks to Amazon return policy, I had no problem whatsoever returning the machines.Here is what I think Nesopresso, and their affiliates need to do to make this machine excellent. IMHO:1- Figure out a way to make the coffee hot, and stop the leaking issues2- Have coffee options other than ""burned"" because not everyone likes the *bucks style coffees3- Let other manufacturers make your pods so we can have different coffee, cheaper optionsUnfortunately, until that happens, I think this machine is a gimmick."
"This machine is well made and fairly simple to use,"
Received Open Box and repacked unit. Coffee pods that come with the unit have a use by date that expired 2 months ago
"We thought we'd try Nepresso experience, it has such high reviews as the best coffee ever and you'd never go back to any other coffee maker.  But..we are definitely not impressed.  We use it for coffee mainly.  It is not hot enough, the taste is pretty good but every flavor we tried was strong even though rated below medium strength.  The coffee always has the foamy top on it, seems fine but not something we need.  For the price we paid (which was a very competitive price), and price of the specific pods you have to buy, and the fact that the coffee isn't hot enough, we just aren't impressed."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I was looking forward to drinking some Nespresso coffee but unfortunately disappointed quickly after receiving it.  Pretty machine, but my attempt to make coffee failed first, second, multiple tries. Read instructions, easy enough but the machine didn’t work. Looked like it was going to work but little to no water poured. After multiple times wasting coffee capsules in the process I finally gave up. 😖"
"For many years we used a Keurig machine and Lavazza pods but unfortunately Keurig discontinued the espresso line and when the machine died on us we ordered a Breville. One of the springs supposed to grab the spent coffee pod and dump it did not work so we decided to return it, but before deciding to order a replacement or not, we ran the samples supplied with machine and also ordered all four kinds of espresso pods from Breville and tried them all. Good espresso coffee has a layer of foam on top called the ""crema"". That is a sign the machine has a powerful enough pump to do the job well, since most of the inexpensive small machines do not have enough pressure. A number of years ago someone figured out how to produce the foam probably by injecting some air, or by some other trick. The Breville machine is great at producing foam but the coffee has no flavor. The 28 samples that come with machine don't have much flavor, nor did the 40 pods of the four varieties of espresso. So, until we find a replacement, we'll use our old Bialetti coffee maker, it doesn't make espresso but the coffee has flavor."
It takes up a lot of room but works nice
"Pros:The build quality - overall finish and materials are very nice.  Comes with a nice set of sample coffees to learn what you like. Nespresso really is very good.  IF you drink your coffee black, I think you will be pleased with this.  The coffee is hot but not too hot to drink, and it is a delicious cup.Cons:Unfortunately, my wife takes her coffee with milk.  After you add some milk, it is not hot at all, not even really luke warm.  We were instructed to heat the cup before making coffee.  I don't think that will be sufficient and it is a bother.  We could heat the milk or heat the coffee in the microwave, but that's already more trouble than we're looking for. If the coffee was properly hot, we wouldn't need to do this."
"Bought at I thought a great price last holiday season. Came with a aerochino frother that hardly froths anything took forever to perform and the quality of foam isn’t there. That is a one star. The machine performs above average but the water tank you have to lift it up out to refill- you can’t refill while attached to the machine. The big negative is the capsules that is only bought online exclusively. I bought a recommended cheaper capsule as recommended by amazon but when it arrived it is not the right version and not returnable, sucks for what amazon recommended. Amazon should fix this. Search the capsule online with the word Virtuo to get the right one. The old nespresso capsule won’t fit.Should have kept my old European coffee maker. My opinion not worth your money- breville should be ashamed they put their name on this. Not recommended."
"Box arrived with very worn edges,  must have been moving around the warehouse a long time before u ordered it.  It appears to have never been open though.  Very loud for a coffee pot.  Upon running first start up sequence,  no water came out. Research mentioned it could be airlocked.  Resolved air lock with a ziplock bag, machine now functions normally.  I am disappointed that I cannot simply run a cup of hot water. Now the flavor of the capsules are atrocious.  This machine created frothy looking cups of coffee in a modest amount of time,  but every pof produced stale sour coffee, a huge disappointment. I do not know how long the coffee samples provided with it have been sitting,  so I'll purchase a small new pack of pods to quality check.  Likely though,  I will continue using my kuerig and give this one to someone who doesn't care what their coffee tastes like.  The machine does function as it's supposed to,  but the taste is definitely not worth the cost."
This machine is the best in the Nespresso Vertuo product line but the big problem is the water is not hot enough. I can use a bare finger to touch it. when it makes a warm coffee and cold very fast. I'm so disappointed and have to change to the 'Plus' model even though I don't like the automatic open/close machine head.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I received the package today, and it appeared to be a used or returned item. I didn't think much of it and proceeded to set up the machine. However, when I added water and a coffee capsule, the machine kept running but nothing came out. Additionally, the chrome version had numerous fingerprints on it. Overall, I’m very disappointed."
I loved this machine and the coffee so much . I bought several for family members. I’ve ordered boxes of pods. I’ve cared for it exactly as instructed. Now it’s making luke warm coffee. I have tried to reach support by phone and have started a case by email. No reply. I hope the gifts I gave fair better.
I bought returned to Nespresso and then a replacement and then it wouldn't work and they would only give a credit
"""I purchased this coffee machine in August 2023, but unfortunately, although it was expected to last for several years, it broke down last month after nearly a year of use and is no longer working."""
"I'm a fan of Nespresso Coffee and I really like the particular flavors they provide.  The Vertuo is capable of making a good tasting strong coffee.  I recommend their Hazelino Coffee.  Unfortunately, my machine broke down within around 3 months of my purchase.  Granted I used it on average every other day, but I feel that the quality is poor.  Most of the parts are plastic and in particular I was told by customer service that the failure within my machine was most likely due to some kind of thermal issue.  I would understand if it got clogged or something, but I think that 'thermal issues' should be sort of worked out by now considering how long coffee makers have been around and how many machines use heating devices.  I'm very disappointed by the machine that I bought because I know other people who have similar Nespresso machines that continue to work for years.  Furthermore, I was told that I can't get a replacement by customer service because I purchased the machine on Amazon, and Amazon told me that I had to contact Nespresso customer service to get a new one.  Catch 22"
"The coffee machine works as intended. Taking care of it and descaling it regularly will inssure a long lasting run.Now the Aeroccino is a different story. It's garbage and if you could buy it without this trash I would recommend it. You can froth with a hand whisk so much better.The Aeroccino worked fine with whole milk or 2% from Whole Foods for weeks. After a few weeks it barely started frothing.1. I clean the machine after every use, especially around the magnet.2. I clean the whisk and make sure it has no milk curd every time I wash too.3. Don't think it's the type of milk either, because it's not. If the milk was frothing fine before it doesn't make sense the same brands of milk stop frothing later.Infact this Aeroccino was so bad that I won't give this machine a 5 starts unless the company replaces this product with a working one. If that one stops working continusly then I expect a replacement continusly until Nespresso actually can fix this garbage. When I pay for something I expect it working."
"I bought this in November 2021. Immediately, some of the downsides were:- Coffee temp is exceptionally low. Workaround is to heat water in advance.- Pods are pricey ($1.20 each). If you like the extra caffeine, you'll want to add an expresso pod too (x2 = $2.40/cup)The coffee was fancy though. Frothy at the top and flavorful, and with a double-espresso shot it will probably be enough to ween you off your Starbucks addiction :) Unfortunately, using two pods per will run you about 8 times the cost of your everyday Kirkland pod :(This was all acceptable . . . until June 2022 when started doing the following:- Leaking its entire container over the course of about 3-5 days- Pouring only half the cupI spent a little time researching how to clean the thing, but it is difficult to find the correct instructions and they aren't exactly easy to understand. I'll be purchasing something else soon to replace this one. Overall, this WAS NOT a good investment.TL;DR & UPDATE: Just to give an update, I've gone through the cleaning process multiple times and the machine will still not fill a cup of coffee any more. No help or assistance of any kind is offered. This is BY FAR THE WORSTE coffee maker I've ever had. DO NOT BUY. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
I am a big fan of Nespresso but this is the second machine that had issues. The first one started leaking after two years. I cleaned it and used filtered water. I replaced it with this one. I bought in May and now found out that the return policy expired after one month. The machine had barely passed the one month expiration by two weeks and it stopped working. No lights and no response. I hope you have better luck. The coffee was great until it stopped working.
machine recieved was non functional
"I cant find enough negative things to say about this junk coffee maker.1) First, the ""space saving/fits under cabinet"" thing is a gimmick and a joke. Yes, it fits under the cabinet, but you still have to move it out from under the cabinet, to fill it. At least with a full size pot sitting in front of the cabinet, you can use the space behind for things, and still be able to reach them. With this, when its under the cabinet, you cant put anything in front of it, as you constantly have to keep pulling it out to fill it, or just leave it out. So it actually uses MORE counter space.2) The swing away filter basket drips coffee/condensation all over your counter, when you open it.3) The filter basket is shallow, due to the ridiculous ""space saving design"". You cant use a taller than average filter, or it bends over and you get grounds in your coffee. So youre stuck with standard size filters which are flush with the top of the filter basket. But, it dumps water into the filter so fast, it over flows the filter, and you end up with grounds.4) The lid of the carafe (the entire maker, actually) must have been designed by someone who never drinks coffee. The lid holds condensation on the top, that runs off and onto the counter, when you tip the carafe to pour coffee.5) The spout on the carafe is like so many others, that allows coffee to run back down the side and onto the counter, when you are pouring coffee. So plan on pouring every cup of coffee over the sink.6) As if this maker wasnt junky enough and poor quality, now, after 2 months.... the carafe has cracked.The maker is now in the trash. I would buy anything from this company, if this is the best they can do. You have been warned"
"So, I really liked this coffee pot at first. However, after using it for some time now, it just isn't performing as well as it did in the beginning, also because you load the water from the top front it leaks in the basket when loading the water which is frustrating. When they say that ""you get what you pay for"" they're right. If I could go back i would have spent the extra money to purchase one a little better. It is very small compared to the one I had before I purchased this one. I haven't had it long enough to need to replace it already BUT unfortunately I do need to replace it already. So if you are looking for a temporary coffee pot then it will do the job however for a more long term coffee pot... spend a few more dollars for a different pot. I am giving it 3 stars because it did perform for a few months but it needs replacing already and falling apart."
"For a couple dollars more, we could have gotten the coffee maker (sounds like “Fister Toffee” 😉) of the same brand to replace the one that just died—the button stopped working. My husband and I did a lot of back-and-forth about trying another coffee maker… He makes the coffee! This one seemed like a good thing because the water front-loads, and it makes 12 cups of coffee. The coffee is hot though we found we needed to put a little extra coffee in because it wasn’t strong enough.There are so many downsides to this coffee maker: first, the handle on the carafe is lightweight. It does not feel like it will last very long. This is a problem, of course, because it is holding really hot liquid. Second, half of the time when pouring coffee, it drips. I don’t know why, but my other coffee maker did not. The front loading area for the water is not real big, so you can’t just pour the water in all at once, but have to pour it in more slowly. This is an issue if you’re in a hurry.  There is a spot at the top of the handle on the carafe, where we usually would hold the other carafe: but in this Proctor Silex model, there is steam coming out at the top of the handle where the lid joins the carafe and so I burned my thumb. Next, the coffee maker itself is lightweight and cheap: so when you try to return the carafe onto the “hot plate,” it pushes the whole coffee maker back on the counter and you need two hands to secure the carafe onto the hot plate. For some, that may not seem like a big deal, but I have never needed a second hand to complete this simple task… Finally, we are used to loading both our water and our coffee filter (with coffee) at the top. No mess and no fuss. This brand requires that you pull the coffee basket that holds the filter out to the side. I did this because there were a lot of little grounds in my coffee today, and I wanted to see if the filter had collapsed. The filter had not fallen, but the coffee maker commenced to drip coffee all over my countertop. To save a few bucks, I feel that we disrupted our happy coffee morning ritual. This puppy is going back!"
"Beware of this coffeemaker if you are clumsy in the morning, and apparently any other time of day!  I am so annoyed with myself for buying this coffeemaker.  I should have known better!  I was taken in by the idea of pouring the water into the front of the machine and the machine's cute little footprint saving me some counter space.  But I didn't read far enough and the teeny tiny little pan you have to pour the water into is so silly and shallow, I can't believe this design got past their marketing people.  The half moon shaped water pan is about 1/2 inch deep and about 5"" accoss.  It takes what feels like forever to fill the water reservoir without spilling it.  Add that to the fact that the caraffe spout somehow just doesn't pour without spilling water or coffee every SINGLE time, no matter how careful I try to be, it always makes a mess.  You must also carefully tuck the filter into the basket being careful to press the filter against the area where the basket juts out for some reason, oryou will get grounds in your coffee.  Well, all of this makes for a very annoying experience.  I can't return it, as I have used it.  But I will be going personally to a store and buying another coffeemaker just as soon as I can excuse it to myself, or can't take it anymore.  I know that day is rapidly approaching!  If you are trying to elevate yourself to having the patience of Job, this coffeemaker is for you.  If you are just a regular person trying to get your coffee fix as easily and neatly as possible, look elsewhere.  It makes ok coffee, but it isn't the fastest machine either.  A dud from Proctor Silex. I gave it two stars because it is cute."
"It makes coffee, but the materials used are just cheap plastic. When filling the water reservoir, it is very easy to sill water everywhere. I drink a lot of coffee and it works for me."
"Adding water, read the fine print. Pour water SLOWLY or it will be overflow easily.With this design (as compared to say a Mr. Coffee machine) does not allow for removing the top and cleaning the water tank. For me, I use well water (no city water available) so tank cleaning on a regular basis is essential - which I can't do.Otherwise, perk time is fine and the burner keeps the coffee HOT!"
"This is a nice put, great size not a large counter footprint. However, the lid on the coffee pot itself arrived broken on the edge, if you would be so kind as to send me another lid for the coffee pot I would change my review to five stars"
I don't like this coffee pot. You have to pour the water in very slowly or it splashes back on you. And the lid to the pot is on crooked so you can't pour coffee without holding holding your cup over the sink. I do not reccomend this item.
This product is very easy to use. I do wish it was heavier however I love the front water loading feature.
"When I purchased this, I unfortunately ignored the reviews that complained about it.  The front loading means that you have a very small area to pour the water into. The carafe spout is made so that you have to pour very slowly or you will spill everywhere. The two together make this coffee maker a real pain to use before you've had your first cup of coffee.Now, after a year of use, it's started leaking. I'll never buy a proctor silex product again!"
"Having used the coffeemaker for several weeks, I can say it is adequate for the task.  The coffee is decent, and the low-profile front-fill feature, my primary requirement, is great. The clock and timer are on the side, not the front, and not easy to see, since the display is unlit LCD and not LED.  Since the timer feature is not important to me, I mainly depend on it for the auto shutoff.  If I were someone who needed the auto brew timer, I would find it inconvenient to use, and if I were someone who needed to frequently change the auto brew time, I would find it very inconvenient.  I miss the tone my old coffee maker would sound when brewing was complete and when shutting off."
Bottom line basic. Like the front water load but no auto off. Need to remember to turn it off or cook the remaining coffee all dsy.
I haven’t even had it for a year yet and it stopped working. It worked well until it didn’t. The coffee maker would brew for a minute then shut off.  You could get a pot of coffee if you stood right there and pushed the on button over and over to get the whole pot.
"Product appears to be just fine. Delivery was terrible and not something I have ever experienced from Amazon. First the delivery was delayed with no reason as to why offered and when it finally arrived the courier tossed (it was glass and luckily not broken or cracked) over my 8+ foot high security gate onto a hard rock gravel driveway-absolutely no excuse for this type of service. As stated, the product seems fine, but I am not happy."
"Makes decent coffee. Although instructions say to use one tablespoon of coffee per cup, that's a bit weak for me.  I recommend using a bit more.  Compact size.  Filler shelf is shallow, so care is needed when filling to avoid water overflow.  Biggest problem is the spout, which is offset and narrow.  Very hard to avoid spilling coffee when pouring it out, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars."
"Yes, while it will make a pot coffee.  It is cheaply made product.  It has a small area to add the water so you must poor slowly or it will overflow.  Yes it does ""fit: under the counter, you still must pull it out to make a pot to fill it.  Ehen you swing the basket open it drips all over as well.  Had to return it !"
"Great space saver,  in fact we bought two.  HOWEVER both of them leak.  I can't even tell where the water is coming from as they only leak when making the coffee.  It's not overfilled but seems like at least 6 oz will leak when they do and it isn't every day.  Just frustrating and odd.Also Amazon doesn't support the format my images are in so  I'm unable to share the mess they make."
The way the have the water reservoir closed entrance set-up is infuriating. The closed entrance where you pour the water into the reservoir is extremely shallow. This means you can only pour the water into the coffee maker at a super slow rate. For seniors this can be a problem since one has to hold up a coffee pot/water container with varying degrees measures of water for an extended amount of time. Whatever engineering team that designed this needs to be fired. In all other aspects this is an average budget no frills coffee maker.
It does make coffee but is designed  poorly.  You have to pour the water in very very slowly or it overflows and makes a mess.  They put a label on it  saying  Poor slowly instead of fixing the design flaw.  Also no auto shutoff I haven't seen this in years !
"Machine developed some kind of leak, my counter top got wet under the machine while being used.Besides, the location and size of the controls was not user friendly."
"I like that it makes a pot of coffee in a hurry.  Being a mechanic all my life I have no trouble spotting a cheaply engineered device, which is exactly what this coffee pot is."
"No matter how many times you check it, it still might not lock in the pot. It has poured coffee all over our kitchen several times. Your only option is to watch it brew. Otherwise a good coffee maker but that is a very inconvenient flaw."
"They must have recently changed the design on this listing, because this is the most annoying brewer in the world. How its achieved its high review status is beyond me.Here are the redeeming qualities:1. I was able to get it next day, free shipping, thanks to Prime. Yeah. That was pretty cool.2. It makes coffee.The annoying things:1. The reservoir is sealed off. You have to slowly pour the water into this half inch, by 4 inch opening. Which means, you could NEVER clean the reservoir if you expected it needed it.2. The heating element shuts off after like an hour or something. This is not 'unique' to this product. I've tried another programmable bot, that did the same thing. WHY?!?!? Nothing more annoying, then waking up at 7, brewing some coffee, then when you go for your third cup at 9, its cold!3. Its near impossible to pour without spilling. This has to do with how the spout is designed I guess. If you barely tip it over, and let the water or coffee just trickle out the end, yeah, i think you can get by with just a couple drops slipping out and hitting the counter/floor/foot. But, if you do a 'regular' pour, you end up with at least an ounce of liquid spilled on the counter or floor or foot. So annoying. Makes me what to throw the whole thing out my window at 7 am.4. The handle feels ""weird"". I don't know how to describe it. I'm a bit of a 'coffee slut' so I've handled my 'fair share' of coffee pot handles. And this just feels very strange. Like someone without hands designed it. Pretty weird.I hope my review was helpful. Don't buy this pot."
The carafe is a dribbler. About 1/2 cup or more of the water boils off before brewing is complete. The filter basket opens up when the carafe is removed to pour the coffee. I find this product a total disappointment. I'd ask for a full refund if that's possible.
I like the program clock setting. Works well. The only thing I really hate is the water reservoir. You can’t clean it. You pour it in up front and it trickles down the back to the tank. Can’t access it to clean it.
You have to add water really slowly or it spills everywhere.  I would not buy this again.
"Small opening to put water in, easy for it to run over if you don't pour slowly.  Filter holder not removable so you can clean if coffee grounds spill over. Controls are small and difficult to see.  Does not come with coffee measuring spoon.  Cannot recommend this coffee maker.  You can do better with another model."
Getting to pour water into the front doesn't make any sense when the opening is so small that it's easily splashed all over. Then you have to move around to the side anyway to see the switch and programmable settings; which you can't see hardly at all because it's not backlit!! If you're like me you're doing all this in the evening before and the kitchen is not so brightly lit. There is NO ADVANTAGE WHATSOEVER in the layout of this coffee maker! I want my Mr Coffee back!
"The coffee pot makes good coffee; however, for me, it seems as though the coffee carafe does not easily fit well under the coffee pot which causes the coffee to spill over the top of the pot while it's brewing. In addition, the coffee pot spills while pouring the coffee into my cup. I've tried pouring it slowly, but it still spills. The reservoir is also small so pouring water into it takes time. Again, it makes good coffee, just too much effort for me."
"it leaks water when sitting there, but does not empty all the way."
"I really liked this coffee pot because it doesn’t take up a lot of space on the countertop.  You do need to be careful pouring water into the reservoir and it does take a few minutes for 8 cups of coffee.  After using daily for the last 10 months, it has suddenly started leaking large amounts of water!  Sorry, but I would not purchase again."
"It's nice that you can program it to make coffee at a certain time. The clock does not light up. You'll need paper filters as the permanent ones won't fit. Also, be careful to carefully add the water, it's a bit slow so it's easy to overfill and make a mess."
"the reservoir started leaking water all over the counter.  I liked this coffee maker, but if it's only last 6-8 months, I've got to try another brand."
"I like the compact size and the FrontFill water reservoir.  But, there are a couple serious design problems.  The designers did not add ""feet"" to the coffee maker so it very easily slides on a counter top.  It requires two hands to serve coffee.  One to hold the coffeemaker steady and one to remove the carafe and pour the coffee.  With other coffee makers I hold my cup in one hand and remove the carafe with the other.  The other design problem is the carafe lid.  It seems to cause frequent dripping when pouring.  So, to get a cup of coffee I need to...  1. place a paper towel on the counter.  2. place my cup on the paper towel.  3. hold the coffee maker firmly with one hand.  4. remove the carafe and pour the coffee with my other hand.  5. still holding the coffee maker firmly, replace the carafe.  6. dispose of the paper towel and clean any additional dripped coffee.  This procedure becomes very inconvenient when repeated many, many times."
"This was not a good buy for us. This coffee maker is ""cheaply"" manufactured and it comes across in everything. It released a tremendous amount of steam as it would brew. It brewed faster than the basket could release, so it was in a constant state of overflow. When a guest would take the carafe in their hand to pour a cup, the pot would leak all over their hand and burn them.  Simple attempting to pour coffee was an Olympic Feat to be awarded! Anyway, we do not recommend at all. Save yourself. Look elsewhere. We donated it with a sign on it that says warning, this appliance will brew frustration and pain""."
This coffee Maker does the job. But the one thing that I would not buy this again. It does not have an automatic shut off after 2 hours. One night I actually forgot to shut it off and it ran all night. If that doesn't bother you then It's a good coffee Maker if it does like it does me. I wouldn't buy it again.
"First off, it's so light that I have to apply counter pressure when turning it on or off.  Maybe some rubber feet.Secondly Proctor Silex has been making drip coffee makers for decades.  One would think they would have figured out how to make a carafe that doesn't dribble.........The only positives I can come up with is it's fairly small and that is does make coffee.If I can I may return this I probably will."
"I have products that I purchased over twenty years ago that are working great.  It is indeed true, that companies now produce products to last no more than three years.  Hey, I would have been lucky, my coffee pot, Proctor Silex didn't last a year.  What a rip off."
Had to send it back
"I don't have real high expectations of a coffee maker for 30 bucks, but this thing managed to underperform EVERY expectations I have. It has a front loading thing where you put the grounds. Problem is, anytime you or anyone takes the Coffee pot out, you're dislodging it. You can hold it in place but if you don't or if it's not snapped ALL the way back in place, the water and grounds just back up and start spilling all over.It's such a cute design. You pour the water in front at a weird angle and...again, can't take the pot out without opening the grounds."
"I bought this coffee maker for my bedroom. It brews perfectly. It's easy to clean. The warmer works great. The problem I have with it is the water fill. It says to pour slowly. They mean VERY slowly, or it will spill out of the water fill. So your pouring slowly and you realize the water is spilling. But now it's spilling because the pouring lip is so narrow. If not angled perfectly, you lose coffee water. The engineers need to sit down and have a cup of coffee and pay attention to what they've created."
"This thing makes a mess. Filling it is just plain weird. There's a very shallow area where the water goes in when prepping your coffee that overflows unless you pour very slowly. After turning it on, some water runs down the behind the carafe onto the hot plate and makes a lot of hissing and gurgling noise as well as over flowing there. The hot water goes into the coffee bin with the filter towards the rear and can fold the filter down and sending coffee grounds into the coffee as well as clogging the output of the coffee bin and causing a huge mess. The clock on it is about impossible to see so programing it becomes a huge hassle. I hated this thing. I just got a new one that is not as fancy, but no more messy countertop."
"This machine does make hot coffee. The drawback k is that the water flows to quality into the coffee basket causing an overflow, then you get a big wet mess under the coffee maker. This morning i out enough water in the machine for eight cups and wound up with 2 cups worth and a mess all over my coffee station. I purchased the coffee maker 6 months ago. I'm not at all impressed with it. When"
I hated the way the basket removes and the way you add water. Bad design!
quickly brews coffee as expected. water fill is a small area so fill slowly.
You have to be very careful with the filter or it will fold up while filling and you get clogged up or a coffee cup full of grounds
"Everything about this coffee pot is exactly what I was looking for at work, EXCEPT that “easy frontfill”. I don't know who decided that’s easier than a basic coffee pots direct access to the reservoir from the top. You have to be extremely careful not to spill water, and it takes 4x as long to pour it in compared to a normal coffee pot. So I really am annoyed with that part but not enough to send it back or anything. It’s just something to be aware of before you buy."
All in all the coffee maker works fine.BUT!!!!! I would never buy it again because you CANNOT pour a cup without it spilling coffee no mater how slowly you try to pour.Big thumbs down.
"Bought this coffee maker specifically because it has a front fill, which I needed for my coffee bar and was hard to find at a height that I needed. However, everytime you try to pour a cup of coffee (no matter how slow you pour!), it drips and spills. Very annoying and messy!"
"I did not notice at first, but this model does not have an automatic shut-off. The performance is fine, but if we forget to turn it off . . . we get a cooked-on layer of dry coffee at the bottom. First-world problem, though."
"I've owned CMs for 50 years. Proctor Silex used to be a reliable brand.  So disappointed! THIS UNIT IS TERRIBLE. The very first time I opened the lid to pour in water, the lid broke!  The little hinge/pins are way too thin.  Then pouring....drip from the bottom every time!  When I thought I'd figured out how to hold the pot to avoid this...well %$@*.  Several times I ended up with brewed coffee all over the counter. No rhyme or reason.I've replaced it with an $8.50 Walmart unit. Newbie is bare-bones but it cost $20 less."
Very loud .  Basket holder is not so easy to close. Carafe is hard to insert as well as retrieve . Makes our morning coffee routine not so pleasant.  Do not recommend  !
This coffee maker has many issues. The design of carafe cover is terrible always leaks when pouring unless you hold lid up. 4 times I woke up to coffee and grounds on my counter from overflowing still not sure why. The clock is not only small but on the side where you cannot see it. On the plus side it made coffee pretty quick and it tasted fine when done I just got tired of needing to watch it every brew. Main reason for return was tired of cleaning up a mess
"It doesn't pour without dripping, the timer doesn't work right and it coffee is piss warm almost by the time you're done getting sugar. Does it produce coffee? Yes. Is it cheap? Eh.Easy to clean? No.Easy to remake? Yes.Does it make a flood when making or serving? Yes."
"Coffee pot works well, I like the digital features on it however I would go with something different. The spout makes a mess every time I pour it. I like the programmable features, setting it for the time you want to get up is nice especially since it takes a while to brew the coffee."
It works well enough but the top where you poor the water is very shallow. Bad design flaw. Water has to be poured extremely slow so its doesn't splash out
The unit is nice and small; doesn't take up much counterspace. But the spout/spigot is TERRIBLE. Impossible to pour without dripping - and not just a drop or two - a whole puddle. Will not be buying this unit again.
I got this and was excited it set up easily and worked ok for a bit. After two months it leaked water from the bottom and I started trying to get help. I did all the trouble shooting and nothing helped. I got this 8 months ago now and finally threw it away. Don’t bother buying this. The small flap on the front where u fill the resivior is too small it will spill every time. The filter basket comes off completely and is wobbly so it leaked there too. The heating plate stopped warming at all. I really wish I had gotten a higher rated coffee pot. I was hoping to get a replacement maybe this one is just defective. Well good luck getting any help at all. I guess this company is a part of Hamilton beach.
"**UPDATE #2 02/28/24******It died this morning, RIP young fella, you almost made it to 5 months******UPDATE #2 02/28/24**I've made at minimum 2 pots of coffee a day since the last update, and every single pot has leaked water out the bottom of the maker, not coffee, water, its not even making it to the coffee!**UPDATE #2 02/23/24**I havent had the chance to replace this defective coffee maker, i'm broke like most.So, not only does the pot pour correctly without making a total mess...The maker itself is now leaking at least 6-8 oz (a cup) through the bottom of the unit.I have to brew coffee with this maker inside of a serving tray with a towel under the maker.Otherwise I have to clean up a cup of coffee from the counter and the floor!needless to say, i will never buy a PRoctor Silex product againIDK what else to think other than I got a defective carafe. The first 2 pours from the Carafe end up spilling everywhere, no matter how slow, careful and precise i pour it! More will be revealed!! Stay tuned!!**UPDATE***THIS COFFEE MAKER SUCKS A**DO NOT BUYTRY A DIFFERENT BRANDTHE GLASS POT IS OBVIOUSLY DEFECTIVEWHEN POURING, COFFEE GOES EVERYWHERE**CAN PROCTOR PLEASE REFUND OR REPLACE THIS DEFECTIVE PRODUCT PLEASE**"
Not a bad product for the money. But next one I'll pay a bit more for a better quality coffee maker.
"Works well enough but, unlike the older models, this front fill is a small opening and water must be poured in much more slowly.Also, I don’t get the point if it’s too tall to be filled under the cabinet. That being said, it’s a good value for the price."
"The design of the front-fill water receptacle is flawed.  Water routinely flows over the edges as the reservoir is being filled.  This occurs regardless of the care being taken to pour slowly and carefully.  The device just cannot accept water fast enough. This, there is spillage and overflow.  This creates a MESS, and the coffee maker consistently sits in water.  In a wooden cabinet, this is a terrible situation esp..  I always use a glass shelf protector under the unit.  However, I increasingly am troubled by the function.  The coffee grounds basket also is an odd size and does not accept standard-sized removable basket inserts. I want to return this unit and will try to do so. I would not recommend it to anyone."
"Makes good coffee, but design is not well thought out.  The area to pour water into is too small and makes it very difficult to pour water in when making coffee making process messy."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            We are seniors on a limited budget and thought this front loading coffee maker was just what we needed to make it easier to pour the water in… or so we thought!It worked for the first couple months, then one morning my husband went to get a cup of coffee after normal brew time, but it wasn’t ready. Instead it was making a loud boiling noise and steam was pouring out. He thought that’s weird.  So he went to pull the coffee maker out of the cubby and the plastic was so hot he burned two fingers! Yes, he got blisters!We have contacted the company and they asked for more information, so my husband opened the top and took a video.Katrena replied back, thank you, and your warranty is void because it has been disassembled.I have all the emails, this is a horrible way to treat seniors. Trying to help them figure out what is wrong with their product. They ask for more information just to void the warranty!!!Do NOT buy their products."
I think because the cup is short and wide that the water doesn't penitrate the coffee to.make.a.good cup of coffee. The grounds are saturated to get the flavor. Happy to have a timer on it.
Love how quick it makes coffee but the filters fold down causing coffee grounds to go into the pot
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            1.)The pot marks 10 cups with an arrow that say full to ream 12 cups. I took a measuring cup and tested it. It holds 8 cups but the marker on the side of the maker shows 12 and it’s full. This is way off.2.)It spills when you pour, the spout has a bad design,3.)The front loader is so shallow you have to pour very very slowly to keep the water from coming out.4.)The measurements are not correct on the pot or the side measure levels that are marked.5.)You can not see the holding tank so if it gets mold you will not be aware of it or be able to clean it.6.)It auto shut off shuts off to quickly, never timed it but by the time you go back for another cup it’s off.7.) The pot does not easily go back on the heat plate. You have to make sure it is pushed in more so than any other brand I have used.Good news, it makes coffee."
"The brewer works fine, other than the spout on the carafe is not shaped properly for pouring, other than VERY slowly. Proctor-Silex as been making coffee makers for what, 40+ years, and hasn’t yet figured out how to make a carafe that doesn’t dribble all over the place while pouring?"
"At first, I liked this coffeemaker just fine. But after less than 3 months, the on/off switch quit working, so it was useless. I contacted Proctor/Silex and they agreed it is under warranty, and they will send a replacement, and I have to pay $12.49 for shipping of the new item. I felt that since the original was defective, Proctor/Silex should be responsible to send a new one. That is why only 1 star."
"Spills all over when pouring,has a weird slant for spout, gets stuck when you pull out pot from base. The handle becomes loose.  We've had to tighten it multiple times.  It's garbage.  Order another pot from another company.  This one will go in garbage.  Don't waste your money."
"It gets the job done, and it’s easy to use. But on the top of it where you pour it is over to the side. You have to keep it pushed up when you pour it or it will go all over the place."
Likes:-it makes coffee-12 cup capacityDislikes:-the power and programming buttons are on the side for some reason (I should have seen that from the pictures)-side opening for the coffee grounds/filter but you need to pull out the pot from the front?? What...how is that a good design?-the water loading system. Very small imo.
"Be careful when you pour your coffee! It doesn't matter if it's a full pot or half a pot, hold your cup over the sink because IT'S GOING TO SPILL! The next time I need to purchase a coffee maker, I WON'T be getting one from this company."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Love the style and size and that the water is poured in from the front (that was my main reason for buying so it could stay under the cabinets and not have to be pulled out every morning) but I’m not very happy with it…the coffee is VERY weak..I’ve tried doubling the filter and anything I can think of but it always tastes very watered down compared to our old Mr. Coffee that this replaced and it leaks EVERY time you pour from the carafe…really wanted to like it and the return window is closed so I guess I’ll have to get used to weak coffee and messes every morning 😑
I bought a ProctorSilex Coffee Maker and it’s out dated. My Carafe broke and I called Proctor Silex directly and they told me it was out dated - they don’t make that model anymore! -The Model number is ( 43685 ) .>>>*** AMAZON… is thier any way to determine if what a consumer is being sold is CLEARANCE or NO LONGER BEING MADE SUCH THAT NO PARTS WILL BE AVAILABLE???!!!***I have to throw 25.00 +/- away today. The Proctor Silex Coffee Maker model 43865 is going in the trash! Money wasted!
Broken pieces  fell out when I removed the carafe to take the plastic off. Kinda sucks since it’s a brand new unit
The coffee maker is good but don’t like me
"It makes a solid brew. Quick, compact, and efficient.But maaaaan can I not pour the pot without it dribbling and spilling. Fill the water? Dribble. First cup of coffee, dribble. Guaranteed, and even when I know it’s coming, it sure is still frustrating."
Didn't realize it didn't have auto shut off.
"Unless you have a reusable filter, you will most likely get grounds in your coffee. With how the door closes, it catches filters and folds it over and causes grounds to drain down. Unless you meticulously check while closing."
There is a terrible smell of plastic which effects the taste of the coffee. I of course first washed everything. Made first pot and was so awful. Now after a week of trying to clean it it still reeks  I put vinegar down through it and then baking soda nothing takes away the pungent plastic smell in reservoir.
You can not dry out the reservoir after using. Can not understand the reason  Being someone who like things clean and dry I would not recommend this Coffee maker I will be buying a new one that allows full cleaning. Will donate this one. Mold will eventual form if you don't use it everyday
"This pot was cheaply made, but I should've known by the price. It works well though.. making coffee"
"The auto brew timer is great. The pot itself spills water or coffee everywhere if you don't pour at a frustratingly slow speed. The pot says pour slowly, they sincerely mean it lol. It does the job. Will simply buy a better one next time."
We have had this coffee maker 6 months & the switch no longer functions.
The spring came off the first time I pull carafe out and coffee went everywhere.  So now I have to wait for coffee to finish.
I asked for a refund because I BOUGHT TWO of these and this big company would not give money back.  Just horrible.  Buyer beware!!GOT TWO AND BOTH QUIT WORKING
"After 8 months, the coffee maker started leaking onto my counter. Two months later, the switch quit working. And of course they used non-standard screws to put it together so I can't even take it apart to fix it.No more Proctor Silex junk for me!"
This product is junk.  The front fill feature means you have to add water very slowly or it will spill.  After a few months it leaks like a sieve.
"It will make good coffee however there, is a design flaw as I see it the grounds holder is totally flat with a drain hole this should drain all the liquid but some remains that makes disposing of messy."
There is a flaw with the manufacturer's mold for the cup that holds the coffee grounds.  It can be with the coffee pot lid's mold.  One of those two molds. The quick-release device doesn't open preventing the coffee from going into the coffee pot. So the hot liquid with the coffee grounds spills over to the counter. A huge mess to clean up. This happen several timesA quick fix. I broke off the quick release from the coffee cup ground holder so it wouldn't block the drip hole. This prevents you from having a fast cup of coffee.
"first, when pouring into cup it flows all over the side of the pot, lifting lid helps. Now the switch is going out. Going back to Mr. coffee, they last longer. This coffee maker is cheaply made. JUNK."
It does work and the price is definitely a bonus but honestly the coffee is not hot and it does weirdly take its time to brew. On the plus side the front pouring water feature is great and again the price is amazing!
"Unfortunately this coffee maker died suddenly after less than 5 months of daily use. It's exceptionally disappointing because this was such a fantastic little brute. It's a lousy 12 cup maker but terrific for 10 or 11. 12 cups will fill the pot to right below/even with the pour spout and can make a mess just by removing the brewed pot to pour. Other than that it was terrific: easy to fill, brewed quickly and well, kept brewed pot hot, with a small countertop footprint and no annoying 2hr shut off (my favorite feature).Only five months of functionality is inexcusable though, I feel ripped off. Will look to another brand for replacement."
Doesn't get hot enough. You need heat to make good coffee.
This is a low cost option for Coffee makers. Its does exactly what it is supposed to do. The only complaint I have is that because of the front fill water feature the reservoir never dries out. I run vinegar through it often so nothing grows in there. I won't buy another front fill model.
Do not like the way you have to add water. The water started to go right through in the pot even before I got the pot back in place.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.
The lid on the coffee pot is off center so when you pour coffee is leaks everywhere.
"Can't pour without dribbling down the side of the carafe, messy every cup till down half way."
"I guess you can call itself self-cleaning??? I contacted the consumer a week ago was told, they would contact me within 2 to 3 days only to ask me more info on the problem still no response. When you buy a product, and it doesn't work you like to have it replaced as soon as possible evidently the consumer only cares about making the sale not thinking customer service keeps you as a customer for future sales. I have bought many Proctor Silex products and never had a problem. I've lost trust in Amazon I cancelled my prime. Should have known when I took it out of box that the product was smaller than usual, carafe was smaller, and the basket was so small you had to make sure when you close it to perk it if filter was just right else it would collapse, and you had all the grounds in your coffee. Would not recommend!!!!!"
"*** updated 1/16/2021***It’s been a few weeks.  I tried one more time but the flavor is still there.  Maybe it’ll go away but I had also purchased a pitcher that boils watet for tea and it’s great with a. French press we had that I forgot to use.  This product I declare as junk for me and regret the purchase thus rating it a one star.  I no longer have incentive to try again so it’s unlikely I’ll come back for another updated review.********I’m going to start this review off by talking about filters.  There are cone filters and then there are flimsy filters.  Until I went back to these flimsy filters, I never fully appreciated the cone filters and this will impact future machine purchases for me.Cone filters pack flat meaning storage is less invasive.  The hood their shape and are less likely to spill and the won’t collapse when transferring to compost or garbage. It’s a little thing but I appreciate it.So, the point of all this, is that mr coffee uses the flimsy filters.  Surprisingly there are a lot of machines that don’t use the cones, which is disappointing.First impressions:The plastic look and felt cheap.  I saw reviews that commented about the cheapness of this machine and shrugged it off.  Other machines are made of plastic after all.  This plastic looks and feels somehow cheaper.  I instantly had a negative association to it.The side windows which advertised visibility from both points was a selling point for me.  What was failed to be mentioned is that you can’t read the clear numbers when contrasted against a black background or steam.  I wrote the marks in with permanent marker to be able to see when filling.One feature I did like is that the spout moves out of the way and the lid snaps it back into place.  Simple and elegant engineering.  I would never clean these grounds out when hot though.  Recipe for spilt grounds and burns.The prepIt requires a washing and a single run to remove the plastic flavor, per instructions.  I ran 4 times after I washed and before the first use.  The plastic smell seemed gone.The usageThe first cup seemed fine.  Additional uses the plastic taste and smell crept in strongly.  I ran a cleanse through it four more times and it’s still there rendering expensive coffee undrinkable.My wife felt like the first coffee had a weird flavor, so maybe I didn’t notice the first time?  The fact we have flushed this so many times and the flavor persists is deeply concerning to me.  I’ve owned a few coffee machines and never had this issue persist for so long.  I’m going to keep trying and if something changes, I’ll update.  I’d like this to be a good machine for me, but it’s not.The water heats quickly!  This is a lot faster than my older coffee makers!The lighted switch is more subtle than I’d like.  It’s a dot vs the entire switch, but in the end my wife and I turn it off after the last cup and it’s not an issue as we both stay at home now.  There is no auto shut off.The drip stop works okay.  A few drips will come out if you pull early, but it does stop while you pour a cup.  A critical feature for my wife.The carafe pours well at an okay speed without dripping down the side.  Some will leak if overly full and you have to pour slooooowly to avoid spillage.  This seems better designed.This steams a lot and should not be under a cabinet when running.  It WILL damage the  cabinets.  It’s easy to pull out and push back in.The summary:Would I purchase again?  No.  Even if the flavor fixes itself, I have concerns about the cheapness of this machine and the plastic used and the health impact.  I couldn’t find anywhere that discussed if it was bpa free.  I hadn’t been concerned because sunbeam owns me coffee, but after seeing and feeling the cheapness of the plastic, and with the plastic taste still present, I’m concerned.It is cheap, the functionality seems good for just a weeks ownership, but the lack of drinkable coffee is an issue.  Even if that’s resolved, there’s concern in the back of my mind about the long term health impact of this machine.Hopefully this is helpful.  I’d recommend spending more money as I feel I wasted $28 and will be purchasing a new coffee maker, again."
"I've owned this Mr. Coffee maker for a while now (since fall 2021), since I was previously making coffee with K-Cups but the K-Cups we're getting too expensive, so I needed a brewer for cheap for standard ground coffee. This was the one I was able to get with the little amount of money I had at the time.At first, it was fine. I was okay with what it was brewing, and it got the job done, albeit it's very slow for apox. 8 cups (10 min wait time), and the thing kept on making uneasy sputtering noises when brewing, whilst also smoking which scared me (it never caught fire, I know it's the coffee steam, but it was still abnormal compared to most brewers I've seen). It was fine for the next 3 years or so.However, more recently, it's starting to feel like a fire hazard. The entire cheap design of this maker made it pretty difficult to make coffee, as filling up the tank with water from the carafe can be messy, since the carafe has a loose flap for it's ""lid"", and sometimes drips of water can leak out of the machine if it feels like it. It's scary. Not to mention, the amount of use this cheap brewer got is resulting in the power switch breaking. I try to turn it on to brew, but it would turn on so sometimes I would have to slap the power button or forcibly touch it just to get it to turn on. And even then, brewing is starting to feel more scary since sometimes drops of liquid can sometimes ESCAPE the machine. Not all water is spilling out of it, but only just 1 or 3 drops of water from the tank.I really don't like this machine. Sure, it served me well for a while, but it wasn't built to last. It's scaring me, and if you're someone who wants a coffee maker and is on a budget, I suggest saving up your money for something a bit more expensive (around the $100-200 range) because this one feels poorly built and could be a potential fire hazard if you lack any ninja reflexes or awareness of the machine's poor build quality.I'm hoping I'll get a new coffee maker in the future, because this machine is starting to scare me."
"This coffeemaker does make good coffee.  But I cannot recommend it since the lid is sooooo tall.  It measures about 10"" so when I need to open it to put the filter and coffee I have to move it precariously close to the edge of the counter.  I cannot open it under the cabinets.  If I had realized the lid was so tall I would not have purchased this coffeemaker.  It makes it a no go for me.  Except it does work.  Very poor design."
There some marks on a brand new coffee brewer and the brewer dont't brew good
When i make coffee i shut it off and warm in microwave when i want some. The heating plate is so hot it boils the coffee. Be careful with kids.
I love Mr. Coffee so when I needed a new coffee maker they were my go to brand.  This works fine to brew a pot but this model is a bit too basic for my taste.  I prefer something a bit more programmable that automatically turns off.
"I previously owned a digital coffee maker that was a total PITA - kept forgetting its programming, and invariably wound up blinking which drove my wife nuts.So I bought this one, which has a simple switch, and that suits me just fine.  I thought I had purchased the last coffee maker I'd ever need.WRONG.  The coffee maker died after less than 4 years and even installing a new switch wouldn't revive it.  In fact, the new switch quit working instantly, so apparently Mr. Coffee uses the switch like a fuse.Why can't we have simple things that just work and don't break?  Or at least things that are repairable?I'm sick of buying the same things over and over.Is that too much to ask?  Cough... corporate profits cough..."
The more cups brewed - the more likely that grounds will spill over into the carafe.  Brew 8 cups or less - works fine.
But 1 for my grandpa a couple years ago and the button quit working. I’m hoping we don’t have the same issue with this one. Will update if we do.
"I liked the ability to make variable amounts of coffe in an easy manner, and I like the ability to temporarily stop the brewing to serve a cup during the brewing process. Some drawbacks included the pot did not automatically shut off after a period of time or if the carafe was empty, as my last Mr Coffee did. If the on button was not pushed off, when plugging the machine in there were sparks between the plug and socket. The caraffe lid did not fit on securely."
"My 2nd high priced coffee make died so I tried to try one of the cheapest ones I could get. That’s what I got - the cheapest one. The coffee is not strong, tastes watered down. Correct measurements. The coffee is not that hot. Into the microwave for 30 - 45 seconds to get the correct temp."
Works good but didn’t have a automatic turnoff
"This is a great, simple coffee maker, but it doesn't automatically turn off.Despite phone reminders and notes on the door, I have accidentally left for work several times and left it on all day. Fortunately, I have not started a fire, but it's concerning.Otherwise it's a perfect, simple coffee maker. The low price was great, it brews good coffee quickly, you can see the water reservoir from either side, this pot's the only one I've ever had that doesn't drip, and the simple rocker switch makes it so easy to turn on the coffee in the morning (when you've prepped it the night before).I think every day that I need to get a different coffee maker that won't burn down my house. I thought it would be simple to find another affordable Mr. Coffee maker with an auto-off switch, but I'm not seeing one, at least not on Amazon.I'd advise considering the lack of this feature before buying."
"This Mr. Coffee ""12-cup"" coffee maker is seriously flawed. It brews coffee, and the carafe is easy to pour from without dripping, a significant advantage in my experience.The bad news: If you're trying to make 8 or more cups, it overflows the filter, getting grounds into the pot. The base of the coffee chamber is too wide for the the standard ""8-12-cup"" filters available at the grocery store, and I've tried all the brands of filters. Because the base is wider than the base of the filter, as the filter fills with water, it becomes heavy, and the filter then spreads out to the sides of the coffee chamber. This spreading pulls down the sides of the filter so far that the water level rises higher than the top of the filter. That would be OK if all that overflowed was brewing coffee, but when the water washes over, it takes grounds right with it. They gunk up the filter, so that you get grounds all over your hands when emptying it. Worse, the more coffee you brew, the more likely you are to get those grounds down in the coffee pot.One work around is to turn it on for only three minutes, then let the filter drain for 5 minutes, then turn it back on for 3 minutes, and let it drain for 5, and repeat until the coffee is all in the pot. I actually finagled a way to do that by plugging it into a smart outlet and controlling all that with Alexa routines, but it actually takes more than 30 minutes to get all 12 cups brewed and leaves the brewed coffee the right strength but not as hot as it should be.The other method is kind of ugly: go online and buy Bunn filters for their commercial drip coffee makers. They are actually too big for the Mr. Coffee chamber, so you have to force them in. It makes it necessary to fold some areas back against the wall of the chamber, and looks terrible, but at least the walls of the filter remain high enough that the brewing coffee doesn't overflow the filter.The manufacturer could overcome this problem either by redesigning the chamber to fit the filters people use in home coffee makers OR, possibly, by changing the heating element so that it doesn't deliver all the cold water into the chamber so darned fast. But they do nothing, obviously preferring to make customers suffer, leading them to post derogatory reviews like this one.I do NOT recommend this model unless you are someone who rarely makes more than 6 cups of coffee at a time."
"Why only three stars?(1) I didn't notice before I bought this coffee maker that it does not automatically turn off the warmer plate and water heating unit mechanism after the coffee is brewed.  If you don't remember to manually turn off unit you'll eventually end up with a burned taste from the glass carafe unless you clean it daily.  Failure to turn off the front switch after the coffee is brewed also causes the water heating mechanism to remain very hot until switched off.  This probably undoubtedly shortens the water heating mechanism, uses a significant amount of electricity over a period of a few hours and is a source of burned taste on the next use of the coffee maker;(2) in less than one month after purchase the power switch used to turn the coffee maker on and off stopped working. The replacement on/off switch was $9 for a multi-pack from Amazon (I only needed one) and reviews indicated that the KDC-2 replacement switch failed about 40% of the time shortly after installation and daily use. I decided instead to simply bypass the switch all together and turn the coffee maker on/off the old-fashioned way by plugging it in when needed and unplugging it when no longer needed.(3) regarding the frequently reported issue of experiencing a bad plastic taste in your morning's freshly brewed coffee when first starting to use it, I also experienced this unpleasant problem. This is not limited to Mr. Coffee makers and it's reported on user reviews for other manufacturers as well.  I discovered that I could avoid the bad taste by simply not filling the water reservoir the night before. Instead, I fill the reservoir with freshly filtered cold water from my refrigerator dispenser immediately before brewing the coffee. When the water sits overnight in the water reservoir it extracts the plasticizers from the units plastic walls and thus into your morning's Joe.I'll continue buying Mr coffee makers because they are a good value relative to the price and with proper care have a long lifetime.  But I'll certainly be careful to buy models that turns the heating mechanism off after the coffee is brewed.Wow! Caffeine evidently makes me a little verbose!"
"The unit works great, and makes great tasting coffee, however the big downside to this coffee maker is that it has no auto-off feature. When we took it out of the box and plugged it in it was already switched on, and it ran without us realizing it for nearly 24 hours. Coffee makers should auto turn off as a safety feature. This unti makes us nervous and will most likely have to be replaced."
"hi folksthis coffee maker will give you good tasting coffee! i had it for 2 month now. Coffee maker is somewhat big, i mean it takes space on the kitchen. Here is what i don't like : the upper lid does not have click fixing catch when you close it. So when i close lid it just lays there on gravity :-)My previous Mr. Coffee had fix click  small latch on upper lid.wierd ;-)All other features are as described on AmazonI usually make 4.5 cups of coffee.Hope it helps!ThanksMrV"
If this lasts more than 2 years you'd be lucky.  I used it about 4-5 per week and it gave up at the 2.5 year mark.
"I’m trying to find a coffee maker that will last a few years.  I had a coffee maker that lasted from 2005 that I used until 2014, and I got rid of it because the carafe broke.  I have gone through about 10 coffee makers since then -and now I can’t find one that lasts 6 months without feeling like I have to do special stuff to it or risk being met with a condescending attitude when I complain after having done nothing.Anywho, this one has lasted 5 months and  I had to open it up and clean the hoses.  It works better, but i stripped the screws and scratched my hand and it’s still not working like new.  This is because im not handy and i only have about 3 screw drivers.So, if you want a coffee maker that just works consistently, and the idea of needing diligence, thoughtfulness, and perpetual effort to keep a coffee maker working doesn’t strike you as fun, then don’t  buy this one."
"Wife and I are pretty much daily drinkers of coffee, we got a lot of use out of this, but it finally broke this morning after 2.5 years of use. The last couple of weeks it had acted funny like it didnt want to turn on, then today it turned off on its own after brewing the coffee and the pot went cold before I came to get some.Depends on who you ask, but for me personally, I feel like 2.5 years isnt enough.For how simple this appliance is, and the one button, this thing should last a lifetime.But this is the age we live in I guess. Things made cheaper and cheaper but the price goes higher and higher.We took care of it, rarely had spills. Im not angry about it nor do I feel ripped off, but I am disappointed that the machine didnt last longer. 2.5 years is not that long in the grand scheme of things."
Grounds of coffee in finished pot. Had to strain and filter. Made weak coffee. Would not recommend
"It has a tiny green LED light in front indicating it is still turned on...it is TOO SMALL.....easy to forget to turn off..It wont turn off automatically. It draws 900 watts so for me that's about 10cents per hour..or more than two bucks if you forget to turn it off for 24hours. I I had realized how small the light is, I would never have purchased it."
Of course I am 2 months over the return window and the paint is peeling on the unit burner.  I thought buying a Mr Coffee was a good choice
The Mr coffee does not shut off. They sent the wrong one or I accidentally ordered  the wrong one.  I want  a refund . I had to go to Buffalo the day after it came and I forgot to shut it off. But then I remembered it shuts off automatically after a couple hours. When I returned home that evening the coffee pot was still on. And it was very hot!
It does not automatically shut off after a certain amount of time.  Smelled like burnt coffee after realizing it was still on 8 hours later. It is still a good coffee maker and haven't had any other issues.
This model did not have automatic times off so I regret getting this model
"It makes good coffee, but the other water inlet swivel messes up the coffee grounds.  Additionally,  Mr. Coffee is made in China.  I should have known, otherwise, it would have sat in China.  Be careful pouring water as the tank is close to the water distribution.  The hot plate is sufficient, but I place my mug on a BUNN hot plate.  Mr. Coffee is not piping hot anymore.  Well, what did I expect for $34.00?"
"It is extremely noisy.  I can be in the back of the house and hear it pumping out the water. Since I am an early riser, it wakes up other people in the house.  I have and old Mr Coffee (approximately 10-12 years)  that still makes very little noise.."
This coffee maker makes good coffee. Some complaints about it though. The price is waaaay to high for this entry level coffee maker. I used to buy these for $15 not too many years ago. I could deal with the high price (everything has gone up) if it would last. I get 2-3 years and the power switch breaks. The one I own now had the light stop working after about 6 months. It still works but no power light. The power switch on my last one just stopped working after a couple years. These are ok for what they are. I just wish the switches were more durable. By the way I live alone so only one person using once a day.
Coffee maker needs to be recalled. Family complained about coffee taste like plastic even though I had ran plain water through the coffee machine twice.  After tossing out several pots of coffee I ran clear water through the machine again and I saw about 30 pieces of small plastic in the water. I ran clear water through five more times and I still had plastic floating. I decided to scrub the back of the pot where the water goes and rinse to try to remove the rest of the plastic. I had to run water through it an additional 6 times before I still only had an occasional piece of plastic.  Please be aware of this issue before you order. This pot doesn’t automatically shut off.
"As this model brews slower than any coffee maker I've ever owned, I found my usual ""scoops per pot"" ratio produced *extremely* strong coffee. Ultimately, this will probably save me money, but I've made a lot of black sludge while dialing it in.(When I call it slow, by the way, I mean very slow. I don't have exact timing data, but I wouldn't be surprised if it takes twice as long per pot as I'm accustomed to.)"
"Bought this to replace a Mr Coffee Brew Now or Later model which was purchased a year ago.  That worked just fine but the carafe began to leak from a slight crack that must have been caused by hitting the glass pot on a counter or something else.  This model just has an on/off switch, no automatic shut off after a number of hours.  The box arrived damaged, no outer wrapping on the factory box.  Luckily the inner padding saved the coffee maker from damage.  The disappointing aspect of this model is the glass pot- glass seems VERY thin and fragile, and am sure it will be less than a year before it is cracked or broken entirely.  Very DISAPPOINTING- Quality has declined!  Another disappointment is the lack of a mesh filter which will lead to coffee residue in the filter.....I love Mr Coffee pots, but this time no!"
Well as i said it is a great coffe maker BUT the top doesn't close all the way. There is 1/4 inch gap in the front area of the lid. I got this to replace my 20 plus year old mr coffee maker as the light started to flicker telling me something may be going on. maybe i can take the guts out this and put it into the old maker. WOW wouldn't that be nice..
"I purchased this 2 years ago but only use it when we have company. I've used it 4 times in those 2 years. The first 3 times it worked fine. Yesterday, it took over an hour to complete the brew cycle and all I got was 8 cups of coffee even though I put 12 cups of water in it. I also noticed an excess amount of steam. To experiment, I ran some water through it twice more and got the same result. Unfortunately, even though it is ""new"" it's past the return period so I have to discard it and buy another large coffee maker. We have a small 4 cup Krups that is fantastic so I'll look to purchase a larger Krups."
Well as it works for what I paid the fact that the coffee pot doesn’t shut off after a certain amount of time is very scary! Already left in over night once.  Other than that it works for what was paid.
"I bought this and just went for the cheaper Mr. coffee maker. I thought it was the same one I had last time. This coffee maker does not turn off automatically and I inevitably burn my coffee in the bottom of the pot. Not sure why but the flavor is not fantastic it smells weird most the time I think it’s the way it bruise. I will say that I’m pretty particular about my coffee and should have spent some more money just did not have the funding at the time. The pot is hard to clean out also there’s a brown tinge to it I’ve tried alcohol and salt and everything and it just has a brown tint to it so I think the glass is not up to the usual standards either. Also when you pull the pot out before it’s completely brewed it leaks all over the place, which is annoying, because I am a got to have it now person."
Bought the same coffee maker I had bought 7 years ago. Mr. coffee simple design. Big opening to pour water. As customary I ran two pots of hot water through it. The first pot after this process I could not drink. so I tried another pot of coffee. I drank 1/2 a cup and through the rest out. Lucky for me I kept the old coffee maker and parts are interchangable. Is the new plastic made differently?
"Most folks who drink coffee know the name Mr Coffee and could usually associate it with high quality coffee makers and accessories. That's what I did when I bought this one to replace an old 10yr+ coffee maker I had.I'm so disappointed in the quality of this machine. I've had more grounds in my pot than ever before. Yes. I like my coffee strong, and no I don't ""fill"" the basket. The plunger doesn't close properly when you go for the 'early cup'. so I've had to clean up a mess many times so far. 10cups of water ends up only coming out to be about 8 cups in the pot. I like room between spilling and pouring so I don't go full 12 cups.I bought this one to replace a no name brand $5 walmart coffee maker I bought over 15yrs ago. It was in shambles. No lid on the pot. No spring in the basket, didn't even have a lid over the water. Years of smokers tar and the pot was almost black. That coffee maker was 100x more reliable than this one. It was faster, 10 cups was 10 cups. You could fill the basket on those ""I like to live on the edge"" days, and it wouldn't over flow.Clearly. The quality of this brand has gone... It's a coffee maker! How hard is it to ""heat water. drip hot water on to coffee grounds."" Gravity does the rest..."
Only lasted for 6 months of everyday use.
"3 months later it still makes coffee, the button light just died, so you never really know if you have the coffee machine on or off... bummer..."
don't buy this model...get auto shut off!
"I've been using my coffee maker to - Uh, well, you know - make coffee.It uh..  well makes it.  If I use good coffee, it makes really good coffee.I never use inferior coffee, but I assume that if I did, this coffee makerwould make really horrible coffee.  That's not however why I write a review...My issue is that this coffee maker is so cheap and light weight, that it willnot hold still on the counter-top.  The slightest bump or touch, and it'swalking around all over the place.  Wish I had room to put a brick in it sothe damned thing would hold still.  Otherwise though - Uh, well, it's acoffee maker....."
"Our old Mr. Coffee super basic coffee maker finally died past the point of fixing it for less than buying a new one, so we bought a new one. No bells, no whistles, just the new model of the old reliable.Somehow enough changes were made to make it worse without changing the basic components.Most annoying thing is the flow rate is higher during brewing, making the contents of the basket come perilously close to overflowing, especially if I sneak a cup before the brewing process is complete. It’s especially bad if I use one of the “gold” reusable filters. Something happens such that all the coffee brewed afterward is super weak and tastes a bit like dirty ash trays smell.I’m using the same coffee, same grind and same filters.Second is the shape of the lid seems to collect much more condensation inside than the old model, so if you open the lid after the brew is done with the pot still on, a fair amount of water drips down to the boiler and shoots out the nozzle as steam. This can be startling at the least and depending on how close your face is, sometimes dangerous.The good news is that as long as you don’t sneak any cups prior to the brewing cycle completing and don’t open the lid until the machine is cool, the coffee is decent and the machine should last a long time. That being said, while I got 8 years out of the old one, I won’t keep this one that long."
"The top didn’t fit well and the coffee maker as a whole wasn’t the best quality. However, it was very inexpensive so I ordered a higher model, same maker, and decided to keep this one as a backup."
"I've always used no-frills Mr. Coffee makers. Simple design, excellent coffee, great value. When my unit finally wore out after about 10 years, I went to replace it only to find that things had changed. I wanted the same style coffee pot, that is, more round as opposed to triangular. There were 2 models which looked similar to my old one so I bought this one.There are essentially 3 things that I don't like: 1. This unit has a larger footprint than my old one. 2. It leaks onto the heater plate when brewing and 3. The hot water spout dispenses to one side of the coffee as opposed to the middle. This results in an uneven mound of grounds which seems to impact the evenness of the brewing.As a result of these 3 issues, I would not recommend this product."
"I have used this Mr.Coffee model for many years. I like that it has an off and on switch, and no clocks or timers or other unneeded things attached. One can put in water and coffee, flip a switch and walk away.Some people fill the pot with fresh water, then pour it into the machine. That allows them to measure the water they want with the lines on the clear glass pot.  I pour my water into the machine from a different container, usually a gallon pitcher of filtered water. Therefore, I need to see the lines on the view windows of the machine in order to measure how much water I want. This has worked fine for years until now.This new pot has plastic view windows with water level markers that have no contrast, and therefore they are impossible to see when pouring in water. It makes no sense for a company to change a product that works, and make it less user friendly. If it wasnt such a bother I would return this coffee maker.I took a black Sharpie pen and made a cheezy looking line on the view windows so I can now see the water level that I normally use."
Awful tasting coffee; nowhere near hot.  Waste of money. Had to go back to my old coffee maker with it’s almost unreadable water level design.
"We had this exact machine for over 10 years. My wife thought it smelled funny or something, so why not get a new one? They're super cheap (not so much anymore). Now we regret it. It's extremely loud and takes forever to make coffee. Even the fitment of the lid shows an obvious decline in quality. You're probably better off buying an old one at a yard sale. But it does actually function, and for that it earns 2 stars."
"It does have auto pause when you want to pour a cup when it's brewing, however I continually forget to turn it off and wish it had an ""auto off"" after a certain amount of time. It does brew a good cup of coffee tho!"
"This is about the most basic Mr Coffee I've ever owned. There is no auto shut off, and the on indicator light is a dark green which is not so easy to see in daylight.I think for the price Mr Coffee could offer a lot more.I regret this purchase.I relied on the Mr Coffee name to deliver a quality product and this is just a super basic POS"
"I've had a programmable pot for years, and it had all kinds of buttons I've never used, so I decided to downgrade and go with a simple on-off button. I love the simplicity, but the problem is, once it's on, it STAYS on. Even though my programmable one had too many buttons, it would turn the hot plate off after a few hours, so I could start my coffee in the morning and leave for work mid-brew.To be fair, it does it's job. That's why I gave it a 3 and not a 1. But the fact that the coffee pot can be on ALL day and cook itself into an undrinkable sludge means I will be returning this model."
"For what I’ve paid for the coffee maker, it’s not too bad overall. However, there’s a couple cons that have made me want to purchase a different machine. I’ve not had this problem out of other coffee makers before, but it doesn’t give you your full water to coffee ratio. At least in my experience with this particular model, it cuts off the last two cups of water, for example if I poured ten cups of water into the reservoir I’ll only have eight cups of coffee produced. That in itself isn’t necessarily a deal breaker as you can always add two extra cups of water before brewing, but I thought it was worth mentioning. The second con I’ve come across is flavor. I cleaned my coffee maker out very well prior to first using it, and I’ve brewed three full 12oz coffee bags through the machine. I’ve noticed a bitter/burnt flavor in my coffee where I didn’t have that in my junky black and decker that this replaced. The Mr. Coffee itself smells like burnt plastic after brewing is complete. It’s not so severe that I’d just throw the machine away, but I definitely want to find a much better coffee maker and one that has an auto shut off."
"Update: Bought April 23,2023 and it stopped working July 7,2023.Update: The basket is completely wrong, it's not designed for this machine.I'm not a coffee drinker but my husband is and when the carafe broke on our B&D it was just a few dollars (less than 5) more to buy a complete system.We never used the automatic brew option on the old system so the clock was just something I had to reset everytime the power went out so it didn't blink and irratate my mild OCD. He's not a coffee snob, as long as it's a good brand of coffee and brewed to his tast he's happy so this simple machine seemed to fit his needs. The fact that it would arrive in 2 days also made this the sensible choice. (A replacement B&D would've taken 1-2 months from Amazon).I like that the water level is on both sides and the overall shape and size of the unit. This unit is slightly smaller and takes up less space on the counter even though it makes 12 cups like the old one.What I don't like is that the lid does not snap close as it should; this is definitely a defect from the factory. For most coffee makers this would mean you'd have a huge mess to clean, but luckily it doesn't (or hasn't so far), plus the lid is very flimsy. Still I resent not being warned that I was purchasing an item that was defective but did not effect the operations."
"This coffee maker is almost as slow as the one I got rid of because it was old. It makes a lot of noise when brewing coffee, like it was old!I'm very disappointed it it."
I haven’t owned this coffee maker for very long and it already has stopped working. Disappointed
"Just replaced a Mr coffee because it wouldn't drain into the pot, this one is brand new and I have to stand next to it and shut it off before it overflows the top. Im not sure what they're doing but they're baskets now instantly clogg up and are impossible to clear. Standing her having to shake it around, push the basket down on the pot - even took both out of the stand to try and drain the baset into the pot. Garbage, 23 mins and i don't even have a full cup of coffee - brand new machine..... crap garnage"
"A little backstory:When I moved out of my parents house in the late 80's, I bought a small Mr. Coffee 4-5 cup coffee maker. I'm not really a big coffee drinker, I had it mainly for guests at my tiny apartment. That little coffee pot has been with me ever since.My hubby used to buy gas-station coffee (and his newspaper) every morning on his way to work...he NEEDS his coffee in the morning...and his crossword puzzle. ;) So, knowing this, my sister suggested I give him a Keurig for Christmas...but that's another story. Needless to say...the Keurig died and my little Mr. Coffee got put to use by my hubby. HE LOVES IT! It makes just enough of his favorite coffee (River Road Coffees) to fill his 20 oz. travel mug.You may be wondering, why did we buy this product?Lately, I've been drinking a little coffee on the weekend with my hubby...his River Road Coffees is amazing and I do love a good cup of coffee on occasion.  ANYWAY...we bought this 8-12 cup Mr. Coffee Coffee Maker just because we needed MORE coffee on the weekend than the little 4-5 cup could make.Now, for the review.After following all of the before-use cleaning directions, and cycling fresh, bottled spring water through it several times...my hubby has had about a week's worth of morning coffee that had a chemical or plastic off-gassing taste. That is NOT acceptable!My BIGGEST regret is that my hubby threw the box away before we realized this. We'll chalk this up as a lesson learned and ""eat"" the cost of this crappy product.For now, we're back to original little Mr. Coffee 4-5 cup brewer from the 80's....while we save up for a Moccamaster KGB.So, my suggestion to anyone reading this...DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEE MAKER....unless you like the taste of chemicals in your coffee.P.S. The little 4-5 cup will be stored for emergency use once its replacement has proven itself worthy. ;)"
"Bought this coffee maker on June 18, 2024.  Date and time of its death:  6:00 a.m. September 16, 2024.  It heats up, it acts like it going to brew and then it gurgles, steams and drizzles small amounts of coffee for 45 min. In desperation/curiosity I waited until the cycle ended.  It had run so long that the 12 cups of water I put in the machine became six cups of water in the pot. I have cleaned this machine!  We only use filtered water!  I realize that we purchased a very, very basic machine with no clock, no brewing variation or timed shut off.  That's what we wanted.  Something that made coffee. Fill it up, turn it on, coffee.  Definitely not worth the $40 price tag."
"We have only owned our Mr. Coffee since March of this year. It seemed to be a good coffee maker but as time has gone by, the coffee is starting to taste very plasticky. I have cleaned and descaled the carafe many times and cleaned the water reservoir. No matter what I do the coffee gets even more plastic tasting. No more. I am searching for another coffee maker and retiring this one to the trash. I would be embarrassed to try and give it away. How disappointing from a brand that has been around for so long."
The only switch is broken and I can’t make coffee now. I had my last one for 8 years.
"The product works perfectly and is consistent, reliable, and inexpensive. However, it does not have an auto shut-off option meaning that if you forget to turn it off, it will remain on indefinitely. I have done this a hand full of times. The result is I come back hours later to find that all of the remaining coffee has evaporated and there is a thick layer of burnt black coffee in the jar. It's a real mess and a definite fire hazard. I would have spent significantly more for a similar unit with an auto shut off and advise you do the same."
"I do not like this coffee pot. It opens from the side, it’s hard to read the cup markings for the amount of cups, and it take forever to brew the coffee!!!"
"This coffee maker does not meet my expectations regarding a Mr. Coffee machine.  It is simply an on/off machine.  Nothing extra. No manual, adequate information, sample filters, clock, automatic shut-off,---I wasn't expecting  bluetooth, tv screen, youtube--you get the idea.  I am not returning the coffee maker.  I blame myself for not using the simple precautions of examination of the advertised photo and reading the rating comments.  I only wanted it to have automatic on/off. Too bad for me."
"Good coffee maker, is by far the noisiest coffee maker I've ever owned."
Did not keep this one - wanted a model with auto off.
It brews good coffee but this model does not have an automatic shut off.
"Second Mr Coffee I bought that had a switch failure and had to be saved for parts after less than a year. Cheap switches that Mr Coffee doesn’t seem to be able to fix. I just bought another one because it’s cheaper to just reorder one than driving around looking for one at stores using fuel. It’s a shame that an American company has reverted to to a throw away product with cheap foreign made parts like so many of our corporations. I’m part of the problem because I keep buying the products but you try to find an American made coffee maker that is affordable. Amazon saves me time and money on the coffee makers and that’s fine but until Mr Coffee corrects an obvious flaw, we will be stuck with this cycle of buying things and knowing they are going to fail. This is why America will still be dependent on China and other cheap labor countries to make our products. How much would a Mr Coffee be if American workers made it ? I’m too old to correct this problem but maybe over time we realize that producing and buying throw away products is dooming us. Mr Coffee please make better switches. I need to get up in the morning, turn on the machine, get dressed and start my day without getting angry at the corporate system and myself for enabling you."
"gave as a gift, recipient says it brews quickly but leaking is an issue when carafe is removed."
"You're paying extra for the name. The weakest part of all coffee makers that just use a simple rocker switch is the cheap switch. I bought this coffee maker because the switch color was blue, instead of the red associated with cheap switches. So, I thought maybe MC had installed a better quality switch, they didn't. It lasted about 6 months. But, you can buy 5 of these switches on Amazon for about $7. And since all it takes is a #1 Philips screwdriver and a pair of needle nose pliers to change out the switch in about 5 minutes, I just bought more switches. I know most people don't do their own repairs and Mr. Coffee is counting on that to sell you another one every six months. Do yourself a favor and get a cheaper brand that uses the same switch. The money you save will more than pay for the switches and if you want a simple on/off machine, you're going to be replacing them anyway."
abit dissatisfied  for the money it could have come with auto offThe last one I got had all the bells and whistles and was cheaper by half I mean come on it was only 2 years ago
The coffee maker works fine however the power cord needs to be longer. What are you afraid that you might put a little bit of power cord with a coffee maker! Would another 12 inches a power cord have broke the bank?I had to order one foot extension cords in order to make the coffee maker have a power cord on it. Put enough cord on the thing to be useful. Quit being such a tight wad with the power cord.
It’s a basic coffee pot and gets the job done. That said it still drips coffee when you pull out to pour early. It’s supposed to stop and hold coffee to you end up with it sizzling and burning on the burner. Pot size is nice though!
"The coffee maker only lasted 18 months. Well, not even actually before I started to use duct tape and a piece of popsicle stick to hold the button down in on position and using the plug to power on or off which was about 12 months of not an everyday use since some days I prefer a cup of espresso or cappuccino instead. Then one day recently I had my daughter and her bf staying over and one had to go and hit the switch off. I got one more use by pressing both sides down before it quit completely. Had expected for it to last a bit longer for the use it got. Otherwise for the time I had with it it had worked nicely. Now it's time to move on to a new coffee maker."
"Hello Mr. Coffee,  I don’t usually write reviews but after 4 (four) purchases I had to share my experience.Each of the four Mr. Coffee products do NOT have the water tank numbers labeled - AS THE PHOTO SHOWS. Both Amazon AND the Mr. Coffee box are incorrect photos. Extremely misleading and IMPOSSIBLE to read. The numbers to read the water level are CLEAR. Who does that?!Given as a gift, my grandparents can not operate this machine without visual assistance. “Do I need more water? I can’t tell...” At that point, the water is usually leaking from the two back openings.The most recent coffeemaker we received had plastic pieces fall from the unit.I AM SO RELIEVED NO ONE SWALLOWED THESE PIECES (see photo).Each of the products is a simple On/Off Coffeemaker and works as advertised and can function with a Smart Outlet. However, considering the four identical and faulty products we’ve received, I’ve removed 2 Stars.Mr. Coffee and Amazon, PLEASE FIX your manufacturing process and update the incorrect product images. It’s been incorrect for many months. Future coffeemaker purchases will be from another manufacturer."
"Don’t buy! For seven months is worked just fine but this week, the percolator temperature regulator has gone runaway and the brewer immediately goes into vapor lock and takes over 45 minutes to brew a half a pot. Very unsafe and wasting electricity.Save your money. Find something with a better warranty."
"I have always had a Mr Coffee of some sort. It brews great coffee.However it is very slow to brew, extremely noisy and for some reason it isn’t brewing the cup amount that it’s suppose to. It did in the beginning. Now if if do 8 cups I get 4. It doesn’t make sense."
"The hot water drips out of a spout that's about an inch in diameter just inside the basket, not at the center of it. Due to this small diameter and positioning, half the coffee grounds stay dry or are barely moistened, and makes for lackluster taste, not to mention a waste of coffee grounds.This is disappointing, as my previous Mr. Coffee ran for over 25 years until it died, and made great coffee via a great design. Not sure whose idea it was to reinvent the wheel, but this was a mistake."
"It’s fine. I found better made from cheaper. The lid doesn’t close all the way. leaks on the bottom. The plate is dry, the carafe is dry yet the bottom gets wet and always hearing the sizzle. When you open it up all the water from the lid drains on the counter in the back. The spout that drips the water isn’t centered, too short. I have had better 10 dollar makers. Do better mr coffee. Idk why this has the good reviews that’s for this product. 3 stars is already being generous."
Reservoir needs more distinct markings for measuring water levels.
"I have been using this coffee maker for about 9 months now and it's headed to the trash. After about 150 cycles, the power switch, the only moving part on the thing, failed in the ""on"" position and I can't shut it off any more. At least I could limp along plugging and unplugging the unit until the Black & Decker replacement arrived.The Good: It worked, it's inexpensive, and if you possess the good sense God gave gravel, you can figure it out.The Bad: A bit longer list...1. There's no auto-shutoff for the warmer. There's no clock in the unit, hence no timer either. At this price point, I can accept this limitation.2. The lid is huge and swings upward. Hence, if you have cabinets over your counter, you will have to pull it out to set it up which I find inconvenient.3. The ""sneak a cup"" feature that allows you to pour yourself a cup while still brewing (If you can't set a timer to start brewing while you're in the shower, you kinda need this) doesn't work very well. No matter how carefully I extract the pot, a few dribbles of brew land on the hot plate. This has been true of every Mr. Coffee I've owned and why I'm switching brands as well as models.4. 9 months? Seriously? OK, the switch is a pretty standard part and I may have just been unlucky but it speaks to pretty poor construction."
Didn't last as long as it could have.
took about 20 min to make 6 cups. ordered ablack and decker from you got it  and it brews 6 cups in 5 min a much better product  already threw away the packaging for the mr coffee so couldnt return.
"This coffee maker works fine, but I just bought a Black & Decker to replace it, for this reason: The lid to the machine will not stay open if it's lifted only part way. Instead, it must be lifted all the way so that it is tilted slightly toward the back, which is difficult if you keep your coffee maker under a cabinet. The last Black & Decker unit I owned had a hinged lid that would stay open in any position."
"At the price point I paid for it, like 40 bucks... this thing is no bargain.  It's flimsy plastic cheapness.  Also, the cord is extremely cheap and stiff so much so that it's retaining a memory from being stuffed into the little bitty hole in the back of the coffee maker, that it's yanking the coffee maker back from the counter toward the outlet and turning the coffee maker sideways.  Speaking of the cord, if you are even slightly unlucky, that plug will not be visible or reachable (it's stuffed wantonly into a little whole in the back of the coffee maker), and you will be digging for it for 30 minutes.  Overall, it does it's job and I'll keep it.  Makes hot coffee...probably should cost 15 bucks."
"The coffee maker seems very cheaply made.  It feels like a stiff wind gust could break it, however that is not even really the issue.  It is incredibly slow (approximately 45-50 minutes to brew a 10 cup pot).  The biggest issue however is that, rather than having the wonderful aroma of fresh coffee filling the kitchen it instead fills the kitchen with the smell of melting plastic.  And this is after not only running the recommended full pot of water through it, but actually running 4 full pots of fresh water through it (over the course of about three and a half hours).  The plastic smell still remains in the kitchen and also when smelling your actual coffee.  I would not even pay $1 dollar for this again or even accept a free one.  I like coffee in the morning, not plastic."
"In order to use this device, you must waste hours of electricity boiling water over and over until the the machine no longer produces a burning plastic smell. Once this is done the device works perfectly and makes nice coffee.Absolutely absurd that this has no research solution and these things are continuously manufactured with the same flaw that the corporations gas light consumers for complaining about. BS"
"I hardly bother to write bad reviews cause I usually just don't care enough to, but this is a special occasion. The first time we used this coffeemaker the ENTIRE kitchen smelled horribly of burning plastic, like nothing I have ever smelled before. And I have a bad sense of smell and am not overly sensitive to smells. IT REEKS. I have used cheap coffeemakers my whole life and have never experienced this before. I then ran the pot with plain water TEN TIMES over the first day as well as once with distilled vinegar trying to see if the smell would go away after some use. NOPE. It's been a week of us trying to make it work and the smell isn't as bad as the first day, but it still smells GOD AWFUL every time. I see other reviews mentioning this smell, but sadly I did not see them before purchasing. BELIEVE THE BAD REVIEWS IN THIS CASE LOL It's literally not worth even $5 to have your coffee smell like plastic every day :("
"We've been using Mr. Coffee for about 15 years and love the hot but not burnt flavorful coffee that these simple models reliably deliver. This one is no exception to that rule but I do have 2 gripes with the design of this new model: the lines on the machine are not printed on but instead are impressed on the inside. This makes those markings effectively unusable. I have attached a photo to show that. I took this photo this morning after having last made coffee last morning. The condensation makes the lines illegible. Without the condensation (if you would dry it out after it cools after each use but who does that?) the lines are still pretty hard to read. My second gripe is that the arm that pours hot water onto the coffee grounds does not get pushed back into place with the lid as it closes. The last model I owned did that. So I have to move the arm back over the grounds after I have put in the new filter and grounds.It still makes good coffee. I hope it is reliable (I've been using it less than 1 week so far), but it does have 2 things that irritate me each morning because my old one had these things figured out and now I've lost that.  Also I should add that the picture of the coffee maker on the box shows the measurement lines on the machine printed, not empressed. There's a bit of false advertising there.UPDATE: After almost 1 year of use, the on/off switch broke and therefore renders this coffee maker useless.  I'm pretty disappointed with Mr. Coffee after this experience and am looking for a replacement brand."
This coffee maker doesn’t have an automatic shut off.  I have to make sure that I remember to turn it off
"Don’t find this to be as high quality as my last one. The water pump makes a super loud knocking noise throughout the brew. The coffee is fine and I suppose it’s ok for the price, but went back to my 5cup version as I find it better in every way."
"Good basic coffee maker, but no automatic shut off of power is a fatal flaw"
Mr Coffee is a brand I use to trust I have a 20plus year old one that still works but can not get a replacement pot for it.  So I bought 2 new ones.  I was going to give the 2nd one off as a Wedding gift but ended up keeping it  because the first one self destructed.  Made a pot of coffee one day and the next day  tried to brew a pot and the heater went to crap.  Wish I could find a replacement pot I broke for my 12 cup 4inch V filter I purchased in 1997.  Cause it still works But I'd have to remove the no drip  spring.  Ya know that bobble thing that keeps it from  pouring into the pot when you absolutely need a cup before it is done brewing. Oh trust me I Looked... but Mr Coffee does not have  a low profile replacement pot anymore.  Found a replacement pot without the ability to have drip stop.  And when the new one that was supposed to be a gift crapps out I will take my 20 +  old coffee maker and remove the bobble  thing.... But Maybe Mr Coffee should have just kept making Good quality products instead of cheepining up. Or made replacement pots for older models mayhaps?  EDIT TO REVIEW  The backup  lasted 3 MONTHS!!!  FU Mr. Coffee FU!
"It works but sometimes coffee grounds get in the pot, it's like I'm missing a piece which doesn't make sense at all..when I go to change the basket after a few hours there's still water in the grounds which is something I'm not used to seeing. Usually the grounds are bone dry so I don't know if I'm doing it wrong or what.  I've had so many coffee makers and this has never been a problem. I'm a little disappointed."
The only thing I have to say about it is when we first bought it the first 50 pots had a super strong chemical/plastic odor.. we just ran water through it all those times. The smell was strong! Be warned! It did eventually stop and seems fine but I wanted to throw it away. My hyper sensitive to unhealthy things girlfriend looked it up and said it was “non toxic”. I really hope that’s true
After about 2 1/2 years of light usage (maybe 30 or 40 times max) it just died. Seems to have shorted out. Get something else.
"From the 1st time I used it, the top would jot lay flush.  So of course I got grounds in my coffee.  I put a heavy seasoning container on top and this worked.  But when my kid made coffee and put the sugar container that then fell off and created a big mess.  I ordered a better product.  I would not buy again. But I got my coffee fix until I saved up to get the machine I wanted after my carafe broke."
Been using Mr. Coffee for many years. Not happy with my new one for 2 reasons. It has no self shut-off as my other Mr. Coffee and the area holding the grounds can't be separately opened.It was a dumb purchase although it works for brewing.
I had to return this. I’m surprised to find it still on the next day. I don’t feel safe having this in my home. I’ve never had a pot stay on before 24 hours!Scary
"My husband says get me a Mr. Coffee they are easy to use so I did. It seems fine with the exception of I put the correct amount of water in for 12 cups, put a filter in, the coffee in, and the water seems like it is going to over flow if I didn't put something under the little water spigot. I use the Maxwell House ground coffee and the grounds are fine. It drips very,  very slow. Do I need to get Mr. Coffee filters or can I use any? These don't seem any different from any other filter. I have switched using a filter to using a permanent filter and it is the same very slow. He says to just put in 10 cups of water instead of 12 and it won't overflow. Uhhhh I bought the 12 cups so we could have 12 cups since we drink so much coffee."
"We were in a temporary rental home, so I bought this inexpensive coffee maker. It works fine and the coffee tastes good, but if you forget to switch off the coffee maker, look out! It stays on indefinitely, burns any remaining coffee and hopefully does not burn napkins, paper towels or other flammable items nearby! The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission should require such products to turn off automatically after a couple hours. If you are a busy or absent minded person, opt for a more expensive Mr. Coffee."
"Update. The inside motor wore out after 2 years. And of course warranty is one. Liked it. But not enough to pay the price every 2 years.I bought this coffee maker the end of November 2020 and purposefully waited to give my review. When I make a decision I don't want to know how pretty it is out of the box, I want to know how it WORKS. There are three adults in my household. Two drink coffee... a lot of coffee. And one is a heavy herbal tea drinker. This machine is used everyday, all day long. I love it. My husband thinks it is too complicated. He likes the coffee, but misses the ease of pods. For the most part I am the one who makes the coffee or tea. My daughter loves the tea. She drinks it by the pot.First, I'll give you the things I would change if I could: 1. It is loud. Drum beating loud. Water gurgling, parts moving, electronic beeping loud. Most of the time this doesn't bother me. But I'm a writer. I am often awake when no one else is. And I want coffee during a 4 am writing stint. This machine... makes that difficult. It is bigger than many coffee machines and a little heavy. So moving it... say to the garage when I don't want to be hollered at for waking everyone up at the crack of dawn... isn't an option.In my house the kitchen is at one end, the master bedroom and downstairs apartment bedroom where our daughter lives, are at the opposite end of a 2500 square foot house. It still will wake them up. I've tried covering it in towels and that helps a tiny bit. But besides noise, the machine puts off quite a bit of steam so I don't want to cause the Ninja to malfunction by covering it and not allowing the steam to escape.2. Which brings us to the next item of things I would change. It emits a lot of steam when brewing and the brew cycle is pretty long. If you put your coffeemaker under a cupboard... it will soak the bottom. Not just a little, but a lot.  I deal with this by putting the coffee maker on a large tray. I pull it out from under the cabinet to run, so the steam goes into the air and not onto the bottom of my upper cabinets. Then push it back in when it is finished. This works fine for me. Just keep it in mind.3. I bought the model with the thermal carafe. I did this because I'd like to make a pot for my individual use that will stay warm for several hours. But... not with this carafe. There are two main problems with holding the heat in - there is a hole in the top of the lid for the coffee to get to the carafe from the machine, and another hole for the coffee to get to your cup. Heat escapes from those holes. Bad engineering. They should have designed a lid that can be closed (I've had carafe coffeemakers before that did just that and was what I had expected.) It helps a little to cover the pot with a heavily folded towel. That will keep the coffee warm for about an hour. But it was not what I wanted or expected. If I did it again, I'd buy the cheaper model with the regular glass carafe and splurge for a thermal carafe from someone else.My husband is right. This machine is a little complicated. Mostly because there are sooo many options. If you just want to plop a kcup in the machine and press a button... this is not what you want to buy. You have to figure out how much coffee to use and which setting to use. I think it took me a month of playing with coffee amounts and settings to find what I like. And I had to do that for a single cup, travel cup, half pot, and full pot of coffee.Remember I bought this at the end of November? It was Christmas before I had a great cup of coffee dialed in. January before I'd figured out the tea. (Less is more for that one.) I still have to tweak it when we buy a new brand of coffee. But it is easier now. I can do that after just a few cups.I have tried a few things in the coffee cookbook for frozen coffee drinks. And they were great. But its been the dead of winter here. As the sun comes out, I'm looking forward to the experimenting with the iced coffee and tea options, and more frozen coffees.For the most part I love this machine. I like the option of changing the size from one cup to a full pot and everything in between. During one day I use 3 or 4 different sizes. So flexibility is one of the key pluses. Taste has become a big plus. But you will need to play with it to discover what you like.I wouldn't give it up. Not now. The first week or two with it, I was exasperated and wondered if I had made a mistake. But I recently had to use a kCup machine for a week when we stayed in an RV. I was miserable without my Ninja.I would recommend buying one if you realize it isn't going to be perfect. It's a little loud, steamy, and complicated. But man, once you figure it out, it makes the best coffee and tea!And something I didn't count on... I would go through two boxes of 80 to 100 KCups a month. So about $60 to $100 in coffee. (And lots of garbage with the pods.) I don't spend half that amount in a month on bagged coffee and there is little to no garbage."
"We have a very small kitchen. My spouse prefers coffee. I prefer tea. I have morning cereal. He likes to cook breakfast for himself. The prior coffee maker took up the free counter space. Imagine the complications caused by a simple thing like an extra tea kettle on the stove. We thought one appliance that could do both was the answer!It was and it wasn’t. The coffee function is great! Adjustments to style and temperature actually adjust the results. The water is plenty hot (no, we didn’t stick a thermometer in it to see whether it’s “gold cup” as claimed. The spouse is picky, and he approves.The tea function is strictly tea bag. Reason one: The ninja opts for speed. The leaves on the good loose tea simply don’t have adequate time to unfurl and steep. Reason two: The drip stop. No matter how tightly you try to fit that plastic filter into the holder, leaves will work their way into the drip spout, and the top will fill with water, while the cup below sits half empty. Careful when you swing the basket open!About that drip stop. It’s awful! After the coffee is done, I have to hit the manual button to reopen it and drain the last bits of coffee or tea. If I just remove the pot after the beeps, there will be a puddle on the bottom from a slow leak. Other reviewers have noticed this. There is no warming element there, so it’s not dangerous, just annoying.That’s not a deal breaker for us, because he loves his coffee. I use tea bags in the morning anyway. But I still have the kettle."
Worked great for a few weeks . But then started linking. Followed the video regarding the leaking issue but it didn’t fix the problem.
"We purchased this coffee maker as a budget wise replacement for a 18 year old Zojirushi coffee maker. The Zojirushi thermal carafe couldn’t keep coffee hot anymore.We are hugely disappointed that the Ninja thermal carafe doesn’t keep coffee any hotter than the 18 year old Zojirushi carafe. We’re already shopping around for a new coffee maker.We do like the many features the Ninja offers, and brewing time is acceptable."
"No pictures or video for this review, but trust this will be all the info you need to decide on whether or not to make this purchase.I originally bought a Ninja coffeemaker back in 2019 (CF082), & once I received this specific product, I remembered why I did away with former coffeemaker: the water reservoir!If you filter this feature within the reviews, you will see a strong majority referencing the same fault -- regardless of the model. So much so, there are YouTube videos dedicated to it... despite Ninja being aware of this ongoing complaint, & seemingly doing nothing to fix it.Within hours of its initial brew, the reservoir emptied itself out onto my countertop & kitchen floor. Believe me, I'm not against returning a used product if I'm not entirely satisfied, especially for the price point. After much research & trying to find a possible comparable replacement, I had to settle for this coffeemaker ONLY after ""fixing"" the issue.So... buy at your own risk. Do keep in mind you will have to buy 2 additional products to moderate the biggest flaws of this product:1. Water Reservoir Leakage -- buy a garden hose gasket to add to the reservoir. This seems to help with providing a better seal & keeping leaks to a minimum.2. Sliding Tray / Pads -- this item is bulky, & typically most households will opt for an under-the-cabinet placement. It steams up like a mf'er... preserve your cabinets by purchasing either product to assist with its usage. Most inexpensive would be adhesive sliding pads, with the added bonus of not taking up additional space & messing with the kitchen aesthetic. Plus, most sliding trays tend to operate on wheels, which wouldn't work well with my stoned countertops.Outside of that, the machine itself caters to my personal needs & preferences; hence, why I chose to keep said product... BUT, Ninja get it together!!"
"Happy, until it started leaking. After a year of using this machine it started to drip/leak way after the coffee was made. Whether one cup or one pot it continues to leak. I tried changing the washer but it didn't help. I do not think this coffee machine is worth the cost."
"Upgraded from 1* to 3*. See edit at bottom.We loved this brewer from the day it arrived. It makes a large variety of coffees and teas in a useful array of sizes. It's easy to use and pre-program for morning brews. It doesn't burn the coffee. Altogether a clever design.HOWEVER, barely one month after the 1 year warranty expired, it began leaking water onto the kitchen counter. The leak was NOT from the valve at the bottom of the tank, nor from the place it inserts into at the bottom of the well (either of which would be an easy repair). The leak was INTERNAL - the water was dripping out of the vents at the back of the machine. Water continued to drip from that vent even after the tank was removed and the well was dry, until all the water stored inside the machine was drained.As we were beyond the warranty I figured I'd disassemble the machine and trouble shoot. No go. First, the screws holding the bottom plate on are designed NOT to fit a standard star-drive; they have a pin projecting up in the center that prevents getting a grip on them. Soooo.... I used my Dremel to grind off the tiny pins on 8 screws, then got the bottom plate off.  Unfortunately, that doesn't access anything but another plate that won't come off without breaking the plastic housing. The machine is designed to be disposable (more plastic waste in our ecology... great!)So I called Shark/Ninja. The rep was pleasant, well trained and completely useless. When I explained the leak, she went away, came back and reported, ""We don't have a repair procedure for that problem.""Despite repeated requests and an elevation to the supervisor/manager, they refused to offer any compensation or inducement. I wasn't expecting a full value replacement for an out-of-warranty product, but they didn't offer so much as a $10 coupon or even a free cup of java - nada.CONCLUSIONIf you want to spend $250 for a machine that breaks in one year, get no support and potentially spend another  $250 again every year thereafter, this is the coffee/tea brewer for you! Way to go Shark/Ninja. You turned an enthusiastic customer into a ""never again"", and I'm telling anyone who'll listen.EDIT:Having exhausted all normal means of product support, before giving up I went on Ninja's website and made note of their executive team. I then went on LinkedIn, found their global Marketing Director & reached out. He was professional & ordered a staffer to ship me anew unit.  They did,  and after 4 months it's working perfectly - no leaks.I refill the reservoir without removing it, to avoid stressing the gasket and so far all is good.So... problem apparently resolved BUT, one shouldn't have to contact a C-suite executive to get routine customer service."
"This product seems to be well constructed but I am quite disappointed in the inability to select the amount of coffee you want to brew.  It has six settings with no way of adjusting in- between amounts. Also most of the time I brew my coffee it is warm, not hot. I like my coffee steaming hot. Let me cool it down if needed.  The little old lady at the McDonald's drive-thru wouldn't have to worry about getting burned."
It will only brew about quart at time if the coffee grounds are some what packed from my Shardor Adjustable Grinder otherwise it over flows because of pack groundd. Works with a Kingrinder K6 as far as I know. Shardor Adjustable Grinder grounds better coffee than my Kingrinder K6. This nice machine can also make tea which is why I bought it with the luxury of making a pot of coffee too. It will fit the paper filters in with the mesh filter if you use #4 paper filters. Do not pack the coffee grounds or it will not drain well over flowing the basket. If the grounds loose and easily mixtures it make a quart and half. With the drain from the basket could allow my water to flow through thaj what it does causing buildup. Overall it is a nice tea and coffee brewer. About 40 clicks on a Kingrinder K-6. 1 part coffee time 17 parts waterCoffee Brewer started leaking all over my countertop if I do not remove the water tank and empty it after each brew. Does not leak every time but I need to be certain it does not leak so I remove it. If it was not for leaking it be five stars. Imusa Cuban Coffee Maker makes better coffee that this although the Cuban Coffee Maker has to be immediately turned off after making a pot. This Ninja is nice if you are going to do tea but do not follow the instructions or you waste your tea.
"I have had this coffee maker since 2022. I got it because I was tired of spending a small fortune on my Nespresso pods.While most of the time it works well, mine, like many others, leaks sporadically. The only way to fix this is to run the cleaning cycle with half white vinegar and have filtered water in the reservoir.Also, the drip-stop button stopped working altogether on my unit a few months ago and the stainless carafe does not keep coffee hot.Also, if you take the water reservoir out, you’ll notice a “lovely” mildew smell where the reservoir connects to the machine. Not ideal.I haven’t used the tea function, but I do make cold brew quite a bit. Highly recommend trying that out!"
"Have had this coffee maker for just about 1/2 a year. I was looking for a new machine after replacing glass carafe 4 times - eventually spending more on carafes than I had on the machine itself.This unit does exactly what is described.  My areas of slight dissatisfaction are individually minor but added up every day has made me regret making this purchase.First, the coffee comes out great. The programming produces a great cup of coffee.  I drink my coffee black but daughter uses the other features.So, my issues?Like I said, coffee comes out great. However, following the Ninja instructions and using the included measuring spoon, I guestimate I use 30-40% more coffee grounds vs the amount of ground recommended by the coffee manufacturer's instructions.Preset settings is nice but options for the ""pot"" is 5 cups or 10.  Of course, my normal consumption is 7.  So now I am brewing twice a day.  Overall, this leads to a fresher final cup but I would prefer brewing once a day.I purposely wanted a metal carafe due to my comments above.  However, you cant completely close this carafe so the claim that it keeps your coffee HOT for 2 hours in my opinion is reaching. My 3rd cup (at about 60 minutes after brewing) needs to be microwaved. Its warmer than luke warm but not what I consider hot.  So, now I brew a 1/2 pot and pour the coffee out into a different metal carafe and now I have to was two carafes everyday.Ultimately, I have a better cup of coffee but the other factors feels like I am suffering a death by 1,000 cuts."
"This is my 3rd Ninja coffee maker. I think it makes great coffee. The unit I purchased, also make tea. I bought my unit brand new in a sealed box and it was missing a part that allows the coffee scoop to attach to the side of the unit. Customer service said that part is not available to send to me so now my coffee scoop does not stay attached to the unit.  I cannot recommend this product any longer based on this. Every removable piece on this coffee make should be available for replacement.  You spend $200+ on a coffee maker and they cannot send you a $1 o-ring....VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR A LONG TIME CUSTOMER."
"This machine makes a decent cup of coffee, but ninja can't seem to make a coffee maker that lasts. This was our second ninja coffee maker and unfortunately will be the last. Out first one died after about a year and we decided to purchase another one. This second I've lasted 2 years and then the heating element behind and it won't heat the water anymore. For paying that much, it's not worth the money every couple years to replace."
"For the most part,  I like this coffee maker. Its easy to use and the coffee is good (I am definitely a coffee snob).These are my 2 complaints.Maybe, I just got a bad one, but the burner on mine does not heat up, at all, so it doesn't keep the coffee warm. Drink it right away or you will be putting it in the microwave. Not preferred.My other complaint is that you can't use the bold/rich coffee option if you want to set the timer. Bold coffee is only an option if you get up, go downstairs,  grind your beans, start your coffee and come back when it's done. I really hate this one.These two features matter to me, so I have not loved this coffee maker as much as I'd hoped to. 😢I've dealt with it for a bit now, but I'm done, so on the hunt for one that I can set a timer and wake up to bold yummy coffee in the morning."
"There is one major issue. There is no heating pad to keep pitch warm. You have to drink it fast or waste a half a pitcher. Issue 2 is that even when you use a filter there is coffee grounds to clean up. #3 it doesn't take pod cups at all!  In description of the coffee maker it did say dont need pod cups, but I would have never guessed that you cant use at all. The price of this coffee maker you would have thought these issues would not have occurred! If I would have known these things, I would have chose a different coffee maker. Was going to return it but that is a hassle I do not have time for. I researched and asked people for recommendations before buying, but these issues I never dreamed  would have happened!"
"Not even 3 months old, won't brew coffee. You can start the regular coffee cycle, but with too many moving parts and things to go wrong you'll get no coffee. The machine seems to have some sort of glitch or issue as it starts to brew because the clock starts blinking after it shuts itself off. Being mystified a few times coming downstairs to no coffee, after setting the delay brew the night before, I still would have to try the manual start 2-3 more times before it would actually brew the coffee (it would shut itself off each time). I'm done standing next to the coffee maker for 10-15 minutes starting it over and over, hoping each time that 'this time will be the one.' It's never used its water correctly either (always leaving a cup of water at the bottom of the basin when brewing a pot). The last complaint, coffee is only hot for about an hour and a half, as there is no warmer.We were pleased with the one someone purchased us 4-5 years ago (still going btw), but the design of this product is simply problematic (anything that tries to do too much doesn't do anything well, in my opinion). Don't waste your money, unless of course you are in no hurry to have coffee and like a little mystery when making it."
"I began using the coffee maker early in 2021. For the first 1-2 years, it worked as expected. The frothing mechanism is a bit weak, but this isn't a steam-based application, just vibration. Even with weekly, or at worst bi-weekly, cleanings, it begins to leak because the seal holding in the water reservoir corrodes. The leak is small to begin with but increases over time. I'm now a little more than 3.5 years into using the machine and it is time to replace it, as the leakage has become too much to deal with.Appliances of this type should work for decades, not just a few years. It was a waste to spend on this when it doesn't last very long. As a comparison, I also have a basic Mr. Coffee espresso machine that is more than 20 years old and still works exactly as expected."
"I do not have time for faulty coffee machines. I wanted to like this so much. I had a ninja for YEARS prior to this. I analyzed the most popular coffee makers when I wanted a new one. I made comparison spreadsheets. I landed on ninja cause of features I loved (integrated scoop, removable water tank). I have 2 young boys, adhd and depression. I do not have the capacity for this thing to randomly overflow coffee grounds all over the counter and machine and ruin a pot and my morning. I called customer service. Convinced them it was malfunctioning. They sent me a new base for free (I had to pay shipping). It still happens from time to time. Maybe it’s me. Maybe I’m the problem. But after about ~6 months of ownership I’m frustrated and disappointed in my purchase.I do like that it can make tea in a separate basket. I do like how it looks. I do like the carafe it keeps coffee hot for a long time.I hate that sometimes it explodes coffee."
"Beware that these machines look almost identical and with the $20 to $40 price increase for the steel carafe, you would figure it was the same brewer with the addon thermal pot.... But it is not. You are paying $40 more for for less of a machine with the Thermal pot. See pictures and notice the thermal version is missing a button.... And a warming plate.At first, I didn't think this was an issue, but after brewing my second pot, I went back for another cup an hour later and it was drastically colder. When I added my milk, I found out it was only look warm. Had to empty my thermal mug and pour it into a plastic travel mug to heat it up in the microwave. I'm sure they removed the warmer because of the heat exchange properties in a thermal pot, but why would you charge more for something that has less cost to make? And it would have been fine if I could have kept the Thermal pot and bought a glass pot for my needs (up to 4 hours heating), but with no warmer, I have to box the whole thing up and return it.My advice is, don't waste your money on the stainless thermal pot version. In the long run, it is not a smart buy. The pot will eventually rust and you will need to replace it, but won't be able to get a glass one unless you plan to drink a whole pot in one cup or make iced coffee in 30 mins. Buy the cheaper and better machine with the glass carafe and buy an aftermarket thermal carafe on your own that seals. After you brew, pour your coffee into it. I think it was a good idea on paper, but with it needing to have a pour spout, the heat escapes quickly and your coffee needs to be microwaved after an hour or two because of it.Besides the lack of a warmer on the premium model, the coffee is the best I have ever had. I have had several people try it and the teas I have brewed. All spectacular. I can't recommend it enough.... The machine with a warmer anyway. ;)****UPDATE:Again, this is the best coffee and tea I ever had, especially using distilled water for brewing. I have since returned the steel version and got the glass version. I think it is absolutely awesome you can set warmer temp and timer. It may not matter to many, but I like my coffee very hot since I use milk. Today I had a second cup after about an hour or hour and a half on the warmer and it was as hot as first brewed in the steel carafe version. It didn't taste the slightest bit burnt.I think it was a bad decision eliminating the warmer, because I initially would have kept the carafe and bought a glass pot instead of having to pack the whole thing up and return it to get a better model with a lesser pot. Maybe in the future put a switch or selector that asks which pot you have.Again, it wouldn't have been an issue if the carafe kept the coffee as hot as my vacuum thermal steel mug. I can keep that in my van for 5 hours in sub zero temps, and the coffee will still burn my mouth. I was figuring the carafe would do the same. Maybe if you brew and forget it, it will. But if you drink 1/2 the pot (I have a 30oz thermal mug), the coffee in the carafe is not by any means hot an hour and a half later."
"I purchased this coffee pot for my husband because he liked one my friend was gifted for Christmas. I thought this was the same one, but it wasn't. There are cool features on it, and the frother is nice, but there isn't a button to keep the coffee warm.  It wouldn't be an issue if I got up at the same time my husband does. When I get up, he has prepared a fresh pot of coffee 2 hours before and it's cold by the time I get up. Not a fan for everyday life, but we will use this pot for our camping trips and get another one for daily life at home."
"UPDATE:  After 16 months of use, the coffee maker started leaking leaving a large puddle on our counter.  At this point it is unusable.  I love the flexibility and taste of its coffee and tea, but it is unusable and out of warranty.  I now give it one star.This machine does it all, it is really a jack-of-all trades.  I find that I am using it much more than my expresso machine because the Ninja is so versatile and easy to clean.I am concerned about the build quality but so far, after a few weeks of service, it is going strong.Pros:-Makes a great pot of coffee and can also brew tea-Has an innovative design to ensure your tea doesn't taste like coffee-I like the measuring scoop and quick-guide information on it-Brews directly into a carafe, mug, or travel mug which is totally cool-Makes hot and cold drinks that can be ""classic"" or ""rich""-Does an ok job of simulating cold brew-Does a pretty decent job with ""specialty"" (4 oz. espresso-like) drinks without requiring a lot of time or effort-Has a milk frothing device (more like a whisker) that works great and is easier to use and clean than the steam wand on an espresso machine-Does not contain a heat-plate so your coffee (and house) won't burn-Brew Basket does not have a drip-stop device, so it won't get backed up and make a mess on your counter-I like that it has its own water reservoir.  Adding water is a breeze-Is preset to brew/infuse at the proper temperatures and times for different teas and coffee drinksCons:-It is pricey for a device that dumps water over coffee beans.-No water filter feature, so I wonder if hard-water deposits will quickly build up in there-I am concerned about longevity.  The machine is more lightweight than any of my other coffee/espresso machines and has more embedded electronics that may burn out over time-The thermal properties of the carafe is a joke.  Your pot of coffee will go from 187 degrees to microwaving-required in 2ish hours.  The carafe is lighter and feels like it has thinner walls than cuisinart and kitchenaid carafes.  Maybe part of the problem is the funnel-lid?  It has a hole in the middle that does not close, allowing heat to escape.  The competition can keep coffee hot for much, much longer.  We fixed this problem by purchasing a decent serving carafe and we decant the freshly brewed pot into the serving carafe.-The (non-heating) plate that the carafe sits on feels lightweight... is it even metal?-Does not make true espresso, espresso should be brewed at higher pressure.  However it does a surprisingly REALLY GOOD JOB at simulating espresso by utilizing more coffee beans and infusing the beans with water-Does not make true steamed milk, instead it agitates the milk to make it froth... therefore you need to heat the milk up first if you want hot frothy milk... but it does a surprisingly REALLY GOOD JOB at making frothy milk and can make cold frothy milk as well for iced drinks-Cold brew coffee is not as smooth as a true cold-brew, but it is pretty good for a quick 10-15 minute processSo to summarize, I really like this coffee machine.  The Ninja has pretty much replaced our espresso machine for the time being.  I like the flexibility of being able to brew hot and cold coffee/tea directly into a mug and I really like how easy it is to make a very tasty cappuccino-like drink.I'd haven given this 5 stars if the thermal carafe would actually keep the brew hot for most of the day like their competition.I will update this review as we continue to use the product"
"I typically love Ninja products so even though they're a bit more expensive I will buy them over a less expensive option. I have several Ninja appliances that I would buy again immediately, but this coffee maker I'm not sure I would. It's nice enough, I just don't believe it's $169.00 nice enough. I got it yesterday, cleaned it and set it up. It was easy enough to do. No problems. Woke up to my first pot of coffee this morning (used delay brew). There was a small puddle of clear water on the counter and floor in front of the coffee maker. Not sure what that's about because it didn't leak during the cleaning cycles yesterday. The other issue that I have is every time I pull the carafe out to pour a cup of coffee the entire top part where the grounds go comes with it. It's not possible to pull the carafe out without this happening evidently. The coffee was delicious but at the end of the day I could probably have gotten the same results from a much less expensive coffee maker. The bells and whistles are neat but again not sure it's worth the price. This is the first time I have been disappointed in a Ninja appliance."
"I’m giving this coffee maker three stars only  because it worked well for about 20 months, just eight months past the warranty. However, this morning it stopped brewing. We tried unplugging it and running the cleaning cycle (which was done regularly since we bought it) to no avail. You would think the $170 price of the machine would translate to a longer life. Disappointing."
I’ve used this now for a while before my review. I was looking for a coffee pot that would keep the coffee hot. I settled on this one because of the name. But it was more expensive than others. The pot does not keep the coffee hot. Not even for an hour. It’s all very misleading!!!  The lid on the caraffe doesn’t even close!!  I’m not happy at all. I bought it to keep my coffee hot and fresh. It does make good coffee. But not enough to make up for the carafe.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Do not waste your time. We received our my new Ninja CP307 and brewed two water reservoirs to clean it, as instructed in the directions. Everything worked great the first brew. The 2nd brew did not work after multiple attempts.Brewing started expected, however after about 60 seconds of brewing, the machine started beeping and stopped running. I tried removing the filter and re-adding along with the reservoir. Still no luck, the Tea/Coffee symbol just beeped at me. I pushed the start button multiple times and it started brewing for 15 seconds, then beeped at me again and no longer recognized the coffee filter. I tried unplugging multiple times for 10-20 minutes at a time. No luck.I removed the coffee filter again, inserted the Tea filter - Immediately recognized the Tea setting. Swapped it back with the Coffee filter - No luck, still cannot recognize it. This was a waste of money and a ruined birthday present.Disappointed that a brand new coffee maker can't manage the simple task of making a basic pot of coffee.Ninja left me disappointed and frustrated."
"I had high hopes for the Ninja Coffee Maker, but unfortunately, it has been a major disappointment. While it looks sleek and offers various features, a critical issue renders it practically unusable: it turns off and resets during the brewing cycle.This problem happens almost every time I try to brew coffee. The machine will start the cycle as normal, but partway through, it suddenly powers off and resets itself. This leaves me with a half-brewed pot of coffee—or worse, a puddle of water and grounds because it didn’t finish the process. I’ve tried troubleshooting, checking the power connection, and even resetting the machine, but the issue persists.What makes this even more frustrating is that For the price I paid, I expected much better quality and reliability.Bottom line: If you’re considering the Ninja Coffee Maker, save yourself the headache. A coffee maker that can’t consistently brew coffee is simply not worth the investment. I’ll be looking for a more reliable brand for my next purchase."
"This was a great coffee maker for several months, but then weird things started happening. First, the water reservoir kept leaking, so Ninja replaced it (for an $8 “fee”). Next, the brewing cup started to overflow. Ninja said it had to do with the coffee grounds so I changed them. Same problem, ninja replaced the entire coffee maker (minus reservoir). The new maker worked for about 5 more brews but then the reservoir started leaking again. We basically ended up never removing the reservoir to prevent leaking. That worked for a couple months and then the brew basket started leaking again! Gave up after that. It’s a shame because I really liked all the brew settings and options but it just wasn’t worth all the leak issues."
"Purchased August 23, 2022. Last week it went into forced clean mode. After cleaning, no water will flow during brew cycle. Run Clean mode again, water runs fine. Support offered me discount on new unit.I think to use this opportunity to shop a brand that should last longer."
"Overall this machine is awesome!! I drink maybe a cup of coffee a week, and love fancy shmancy frothed versions. My husband likes a half pot of classic black coffee a day. This was the perfect addition to our divided home! However we couldn’t quite get past the funky taste (almost chemical like) that we discovered was from the stainless pot (despite running it through manufactures cleaning recommendations, running a 1 hour cleaning cycle, running two batches of water/vinegar, and cleaning everything with Dawn dish soap-however when we used a regular coffee mug rather than the stainless carafe it was delish) so we decided to return it and instead purchase a similar version but with the glass carafe.  The version with the glass carafe is perfection! It has taken some tweaking to decide exactly how many scoops we like for our particular beverage (my husband was annoyed by that and just wanted to make a good pot of coffee without having to screw around), but after a few tries we’ve perfected our preferences-I’ve included a picture of our personal faves so far.Aside from glass vs stainless carafe, here are other differences between the two:-The stainless version does NOT have a warming plate, as they’re not to be used with the stainless pot. The glass version does have a warming plate that is optional if you turn it on or not (can only be turned on with half or full carafe options). If you definitely want a warming plate, get the glass version and then buy the stainless part separate special occasion use.-The stainless version comes with a fancy 40 recipe ninja drink book, where the glass version comes with a 10 recipe version."
"My wife and I drink a decent amount of coffee. We aren't coffee snobs but enjoy a good cup that isn't so bitter. I did a bit of research and settled on the Ninja as we were specifically looking for a thermal carafe machine. We typically do regular drip and the options of brew sizes is a nice feature. The milk frother is useful and works well but we honestly don't use it much. The concentrated ""specialty"" brew did a nice job mimicking espresso for a latte style drink. We've generally raved about this machine up until a couple weeks ago when we started finding water on our counter top. It seems that the tank to machine connection point doesn't have a great seal and research on the issue shows some home remedy options using water hose gaskets.We submitted a warranty claim and the response from Ninja was less than stellar. We submitted our information online but the only way to initiate warranty was by phone. The hold time was a bit long and the agent on the phone made it seem as though he was doing us a favor to send out a new tank. They ""only"" had 20 in the warehouse and weren't sure if we'd get one and he had no response when we inquired ""what if we don't"". We'll have to call back if one doesn't arrive in 3-5 days. At that time the wait is 4-6 weeks, which is a long time to deal with water on the counter & floor on a ~$200 machine. I'm also doubtful that a new tank will resolve the leak as the tank is not the component with the rubber seal.This review would've been 5 stars up until the leak and our involvement with customer service."
"As with other reviewers, I find this coffee maker a good purchase.  Makes great coffee, has many functions ( which I don't use) that others like (I just want great coffee).  My initial purchase of this maker was in 2021.  Probably used it a good 6 months before problems.  As with others, the water reservoir started leaking  - arbitrarily.  Wake up to water all over the counter and floor; next day, no issue.  Tried cleaning, making sure no particles in the outlet at the bottom of reservoir, etc.  Still leaked all over . Finally called Ninja for advice.  Good customer service - they sent me a new unit with a $20 charge for shipping.  I had to cut the electrical cord (during a video call, so the could watch) on the old unit, which was fine.  At least I still have a spare carafe, if needed.  Received new unit promptly from Ninja, used it about 2 weeks before same problem reared its ugly head.  As much as I really like this coffee maker, I will not be purchasing another Ninja ."
"After several weeks of comparing coffee makers, I opted for the CP307 model instead of the CFP307 to brew both drip coffee and tea. We even upgraded to the thermal carafe version. I was quite excited and immediately tried out our new Ninja coffee maker. However, our experience didn't meet our expectations.Firstly, I noticed that the thermal carafe model didn't come with a warming plate, which was a letdown. Secondly, the thermal carafe was supposed to keep coffee hot for up to 2 hours, but in reality, it stayed warm for a maximum of 40 minutes before cooling down rapidly at the 75-degree room temperature. By the two-hour mark, the coffee had cooled significantly, requiring reheating in the microwave.We purchased this coffee maker to replace our five-year-old Ninja coffee bar, and we expected the thermal carafe to be an upgrade. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case. Additionally, I found that the ""rich"" setting on the CP307 didn't produce coffee as rich as the ""regular"" setting on our first-generation Ninja coffee maker.It's important to note that the CP307 model with a thermal carafe does not include the warming plate feature. We waited for a prime deal to purchase it but now we decided to return it the next day. Instead of an upgrade, it felt more like a downgrade this time."
"I bought one of the original Ninja coffee makers and LOVED it. I loved the flexibility of making one cup, half pot (perfect for a single gal!) and all of the other features for over ice, strong, etc. In fact, I converted at least 5 people I know to that coffee maker.Prime day rolled around and the “clean” button was on more than it was off on the old pot (we have very hard water) and my fiancé complains the pot is too small. So we upgraded.The whole coffee maker has a larger foot print on my counter. The drip stop SUCKS. No drips stop. It has more ridges and surfaces to collect dust, grounds, etc. The water reservoir is more rectangular, making it harder to fill using the spray nozzle. I liked how the old water reservoir wasn’t as blocked by black plastic in the new design, letting light through it. It not only took up less space, it looked sleeker and was easier to keep clean.Usually version 5 (or whatever) of the same model by the same manufacturer has quirks improved, new features and other incentives to buy the latest version. This was not true of the Ninja coffee maker engineers. I’m disappointed."
"I can't rate this product because when I got it the machine did not work.  I ended up calling the technical support for Ninja and they are sending me another one to replace this one.  For some reason, the electronic computer portion wasn't working and it would only brew one cup and stop.  So Ninja is sending another one free of charge of course.  The technician said there is supposed to be a click sound when the basket slides back into place, this one did not have a click sound and it was not reading the type of basket that was in place so it was constantly flashing both at the same time ""Coffee"" and ""Tea"".  The positive thing though is that Ninja support was there to back up their product.  I can rate though how nice it looks and that the quality seems pretty solid.  I like the metal carafe.  I look forward to getting to use it."
"I bought this in a special Amazon hot deal. We replaced a Cuisinart that did a carafe or a k-cup. I just snapped this up because of the price thinking of course it would have k-cup feature …it was such a pain to pack up and return we just kept it. Our Cuisinart had a programmable feature; this does not. The coffee is ok. Is does make a great cup of cold brew, an individual cup ( small or large) and will do a thermal carafe. but we were really disappointed that it just seems crazy to include all of that but not the programmable feature… I wished I had returned it. Oh, it also does tea if you are interested in that! It has lots of features; just not the ones I wanted!!! Plus, it doesn’t  have a keep warm feature as others have mentioned…so if my husband makes a pot when he gets up at 5:30… it’s just warm by 10:00 or so. I just think Ninja left off some pretty important baseline features people want and I should have done my homework! I have several Ninja products."
"NOTE: I have requested a replacement unit to see if the following issue clears up. If the problem is resolved I will update.Upon receiving my new Ninja CP307, I first made a cup of tea wanted to test out the Tea functions. Everything worked great, tea turned out as expected. The next morning I went to make a pot of coffee.I used 5 large Ninja spoon fulls of fresh unground beans. Put them in the grinder, then filled the filter with the freshly ground beans. Selected Classic brew.Brewing started expected, however after about 60 seconds of brewing, the machine started beeping and no longer recognized that the Coffee cup was inserted. I tried removing the filter and re-adding (spilling coffee everywhere, that was awesome). Still no luck, the Tea/Coffee symbol just beeped at me. I pushed the start button multiple times and magically it started brewing... for 15 seconds, then beeped at me again and no longer recognized the coffee filter.I removed the coffee filter again, inserted the Tea filter - Immediately recognized the Tea setting. Swapped it back with the Coffee filter - No luck, still cannot recognize it. I'm now left with a partial carafe of coffee and no way to finish brewing.I'm not about to continue fighting with a brand new coffee maker that can't manage the simple task of making a basic pot of coffee. I have spoken with Amazon support and I'll be getting a replacement maker tomorrow. I will update this review with my experience using the replacement coffee maker as soon as I receive it.Highly disappointed and frustrated at this point."
"Loved the separate coffee & tea filters, and ways to make specialty coffee & teas. But major deal breaker was, it didn't keep coffee hot enough! So disappointed! The carafe is ""thermal"" but did not keep coffee hot. There is no warmer! I found myself having to put my coffee cup in microwave cause who wants delicious lukewarm coffee?"
"This is an awesome coffee/tea machine. It really is. It's got a lot of cool features and it brews fast, hot coffee.It only works for about 17-19 months though. I'd expect a lot longer for the price.  We've put only distilled water in it to minimize the need for descaling with vinegar. In fact, the machine has never actually asked us to descale it but we have done so a few times regardless. Currently it won't pull water to make half a pot of coffee. It will make a travel mug, but not a half pot. The drip stop also has stopped working. It moves, but it just pushes the filter cup section out away from the machine and stops the entire production. We have taken apart the filter cup section to clean that since it does get sticky with coffee. It still doesn't work properly. Very disappointed and would not recommend this machine to a friend... I wouldn't want my friend to be replacing their machine every other year."
"The water reservoir leaked all the water out and onto the counter/floor several times. I thought I wasn't seating it on the base properly, but I've not been able to tell what causes it...it's very random. Go to bed at night after programming the coffee maker and wake up to an entire reservoir of water on the counter/floor...multiple times. Called Ninja who video chatted to see the reservoir. Then I was told I'd have to pay $24.95 for a new reservoir because it's an ""accessory"" not covered by the warranty. How does the coffee maker operate without it if it's an accessory? When I pushed back, they offered 50% off...I declined because it's an essential part that should be covered. Asked for a supervisor but (of course) their line is busy. They finally offered to send me a new reservoir for free just this one time. The rep was very polite but this is a terrible way to treat customers after they pay good money for a product and the manufacturer doesn't want to replace defective components because they consider them ""accessories""."
"We bought this system in September 2022 and have loved using it until the last couple of months. We drink a lot of tea and a fair amount of coffee in our household throughout the week. It has been beneficial to have a brewing system that does both and uses a separate coffee and tea basket to avoid the coffee-flavored tea and tea-flavored coffee problem.One huge con that I have noticed: After a while, we started having to use more and more tea to get the same amount of flavor that we would get from using a kettle. Even now, our tea is weaker and I have a difficult time differentiating our different tea flavors after brewing. I believe what is happening is that the plastic of the tea basket has absorbed the flavor to the teas, but I'm not really sure. Sometimes the tea will just taste weird or off...not sure how else to describe. I might have to go back to using a kettle to make tea. This is huge bummer because the machine takes up a significant amount of counter space just to be used a few days a week to make coffee.Once this breaks I'll probably just  go back to my little 4-cup Mr. Coffee maker and use the electric kettle for tea. Good concept but not ideal for an avid tea drinker."
Makes good coffee but there is no hot plate. The metal carafe doesn’t keep coffee hot as it should for very long. We have to reheat in microwave before we can finish a half carafe. The picture when ordering had a glass carafe. Not sure why that isn’t what I received. We kept it because we thought the stainless was better insulated and wouldn’t need it. We were wrong!
"Almost all my appliances are ninja this is my 2nd coffee maker. The first one last 8 years this one only last 2 years. It randomly shuts off and resets clock mid brew cycle or shuts off when you hit start. The drip stop doesn’t always work. It will fill basket and not drain or not close. It made good coffee while it worked. I can’t even get the clean cycle to work without it shutting off. I have never used the tea function so I can’t comment on that. It cleaned regularly with descaler and coffee machine cleaner, occasionally with vinegar. This machine was a disappointment for the price. I’m not sure it didn’t last as long as the older machine. Iffy on buying another ninja coffee maker after this experience"
"Be advised, This product has stopped working after nearly 8 months. It seems to be a common error based on my research.Update———-It took 2 phone calls to customer service to pay shipping for a replacement base, which was identified as the problem. The first call had technical difficulty one the video share began. I took a hot minute to call back, and reached a customer “server “ on May 1st at 1:24pm. The time may seem irrelevant to the context, but wait- the server must have heard the longing in my voice for a hot cup of joe because that base arrived fedex before 12:00pm.Truth- this thing will go on you- be prepared to spend 27$ on shipping, or.. buy from a local vendor with a no nonsense return policy for ease.  It’s a good little ninja-barista. And it has a decent warranty.Thank you for reading til the end.That’s it.The end."
"Makes a great cup of coffee, but the water tank is janky:-I usually have to set it to brew a larger amount of coffee than I'm actually making, because any setting smaller than a half pot doesn't brew all the water in the tank (it leaves a good inch or two of it). So if I want to brew an XL travel cup of coffee, I'll set it to brew a half pot. The ""no water"" error message I get is annoying but at least I have the full amount of coffee I wanted.-Twice now, when I've set the coffee to brew on a timer, I've walked in on a counter and floor covered in water. It must be leaking out of the tank itself, because it's just water, not brewed coffee. It only happens when I set it on a timer, though. If this keeps up I may have to send it in for repairs.A minor thing: the coffee spoon that hangs off the side (cool feature!) for some reason stopped ""snapping"" on to its mount and just hangs off it loosely now. No reason I can discern.Cool features otherwise. Just too buggy for me to recommend purchasing."
"I bought this coffee maker after being influences by the reviews.  It is certainly easy to use, but there are a couple of things that are really disappointing.  Probably the most important one is that the carafe does NOT keep the coffee hot.  It cools off significantly is 15-20 minutes.  The second thing is that it requires quite a bit more coffee grounds than my last coffee maker to make coffee that has any flavor.  I would not buy it again."
"Thi coffee maker, once you figure it out makes really good coffee.  Don't expect much help from the instructions because they are really bad.This has features similar to a pour over coffee maker like a bloom cycle and a head that distributes water over the coffee grounds.  You'd think there would be information in the instructions about this - well you'd be wrong.  No info in the instructions about this.  You'd also think there would be information in the instructions about the difference between clasic coffee mode and rich mode.  Wrong again.  And you would think there would be information about why neither of the coffee modes uses all the water in the supply tank.  No again.  And btw did you want to make enough coffee for 2 16 oz travel mugs - well no, wrong - not doing that.  You'll be making a cup, kind of a half pot or an almost full pot since it doesn't actually use all the water in the tank for the lines on the supply tank for any of these.  Very frustrating to say the least and a shame because this could be great.It thinks it's so smart it's actually STUPID and frustrating.  But it does make a good cup of coffee... We'll keep it and live with its quirkness but what a shame...UPDATE, we have been using coffee maker for 6 months now.  Have sporadically had the coffee maker dump water from resevoir onto the counter top.  No rhyme or reason we have been able to figure out for why it decides to  occasionally dump water on the counter.  Now at 6 months old it's regularly dumping water on the counter.  So time to check with Ninja for warranty and see what they'll do to address issue.So frustrating because when it works it makes really good coffee."
"Was so excited as it does both coffee and tea and has a shower head type spout But this still doesn't get my coffee hot enough with each brew and the tea feature does not steep long enough as it should. So what i do is transfer the water into my tea pot that's made to just hold hot water to steep the fresh tea leaves since it's faster to heat water in the coffee pot than boil water on stove. However, the machine works better than all the k cup machines I've ever had as the coffee tastes better and is hotter than the k cups, even though not as hot as I'd still like it to be lol. It does take super long to make a cup too. And because the water sits for so long in the coffee filter itself, it causes the coffee to rise above the filter and gets some grinds in my cup of I add too much coffee.... so making enough to fill the pot that comes with it is hard when it can't hold to much coffee without over flowing the filter."
"We have owned many ninja coffee maker. This plastic used on this machine is gross. If you touch The water container- a disgusting burnt plastic smells stays on your hand for hours. It doesn’t wash off the container- nor you hands. We reached out to ninja, they replaced it. BUT the second one we received has the same problem. When we called ninja again they pretty much said- nothing we can do. It happens to both my husband and I. I’m about to throw it in the garbage and never use ninja again. So frustrated."
Liked the coffee maker for the most part. But almost exactly 2yrs later the heating element is already out. Every other coffee maker I've had has lasted 4 or 5yrs.They make it stupid hard to take apart to work on it. I'll prob be moving on from Ninja products.
"It is hard to be fair since both the glass carafe with the warming plate and the thermal, fall under the same review platform for review.The coffee maker is wonderful and we love it.We would give the thermal carafe 1 star though. We fill the carafe with hot water and let the hot pour over the exterior before brewing. Then after it brews, put a pot holder over the top to keep the heat in. Even with that, we have decided it is best to brew 1/2 pots twice so we don't fight to keep the coffee at a drinkable temperature. It literally causes stress and that is just crazy. Even after an hour of brewing, we have to start over, or heat the coffee in a pot on the stove...in the summer, what a bummer : ("
It's a coffee maker with a carafe that doesn't keep coffee hot for more than 30 minutes. You drink the pot that fast? Go for it. I never got around to trying the advanced features - it didn't satisfy the most basic one for me.
I’ve used Ninja coffee makers for 8 years. I bought this one last year and it makes good coffee but the water reservoir does not connect properly so it leaks every time I use it which is very inconvenient.
"I really wanted to love this coffee pot.  However, I'm on the 2nd one (warranty replacement) in 5 months because it leaks due to poor/leaky design of the water reservoir.  I will not be purchasing again, and I will be finding something new already.It makes great coffee & tea.  The customizable flavor/strength features are awesome.  I love the timer.  The insulated carafe is ok - it doesn't keep it as hot as long as other brands I've had, but its ok.  The built in frother is ok - but doesn't froth as ""strongly"" as my little handheld battery ones.I love my other Ninja products, but this one doesn't live up to the brand/name reputation."
"Updated 11/11/23  Great tasting coffee but the carafe won’t keep it hot.  The temperature drops rapidly and does not stay hot for more than about 15 minutes even though the manufacturer promises 2 hours. I called manufacturer and asked to switch to the version with glass pot and warming plate and they would not make the exchange.  I wil be shopping for a new coffee maker.  This one was an expensive mistake.Previous comment:I’m traditionally a percolator fan because of the superior taste. But I wanted the option to make a single cup without use of pods and a timer option to wake up to freshly made coffee.  So after a ton of research I decided to try this one.I’ve grown very fond of this coffee maker. However, There are two things that keep me from giving it 5 stars.First, I wish I could close the hole in the lid after brewing cycle to keep it hot longer.  The manufacturer claims it remains hot for two hours, but It loses significant heat over that time and becomes luk-warm once I add a small bit of milk.Second, It should recognize if the pot or cup is missing before turning on. If you forget them, you’ll end up with coffee  all over your kitchen floor!There is one added benefit…. I’m spending less on coffee because I can now make a great tasting single cup of coffee when that’s all I need."
"I purchased this coffee maker on December 10th of 2019.  It is now December 7th of 2020 and it stopped working this morning.  It shuts itself off (completely off as if it has lost power from an outage) resetting the clock when I attempt to brew anything (coffee or tea).  This coffee maker replaced my 15 year old Gevalia coffee maker.  Modern tech really frustrates me, especially when I consider how much I paid for this one versus my FREE Gevalia coffee maker.  I will never buy a Ninja product again if they can't even last a year and judging how their customer support treats customers, I will never take the risk with anymore of their products.UPDATE on 2020-12-09:Yesterday, I contacted customer support via phone.  Their CSR (customer service representative) was very responsive and professional and after a brief video call to establish the problem that I initially described to her, she suggested sending out a replacement coffee maker and at that time, she told me that it was going to cost $20 for shipping and handling.  I went ahead and paid for it because of the cost/benefit ratio (and they know this). I, at least, wanted to update anyone looking to purchase a Shark/Ninja product.  Like other reviewers, I think it is disingenuous to state that your product has a warranty but then charge a customer for some aspect of the replacement when the fact was established that there is a defect covered under said warranty.  Future customers should factor this aspect of their business model into future purchase decision making. I certainly will because this is the first time in over forty years of being a consumer that I have seen this sort of business practice.  Shark/Ninja really needs to ""make a better mouse trap"" rather than double charge their customers for their defective products that are covered under their own warranty."
"So disappointed with this coffee maker and with Ninja customer service. The water reservoir started leaking and water would spill out from the bottom all over the counter top after just a couple of months of use. Since the Amazon return window was closed, I had to deal with Ninja customer service. They offered to replace just the base of the unit, but I was expected to return the original base and pay for shipping! After demanding to speak with a supervisor, the shipping was waived and I did receive a new base. After a few months, the same leaking started happening AND during the brewing cycle coffee started spewing out of the holder where the coffee grounds are placed. Called customer service again and they offered the same solution with only replacing the base. I again had to request a manager to waive the shipping fee. Same thing happened with the now THIRD unit after only a couple of months use. I once again called customer service and this time requested a refund. They stated they could not issue a refund because the unit was purchased from Amazon. The representative said the only thing they could offer is to send an entire new unit but I would be required to pay shipping. I did not agree with paying shipping when I have already paid $250 for a defective product! I once again asked to speak to a manager and the representative said I would have to receive a call back within 2-4 hours. I politely expressed my disappointment with the service provided and mentioned that I did choose the option to leave feedback after my call and the representative disconnected me so I couldn't leave feedback! So, I'm still stuck with the defective product. DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEE MAKER!"
"I'd like to point out that Amazon was amazing; They delivered the system with no issues, it's however the after effects of purchasing this product that is very much so undesirable. If there are any parts that you need for your machine you only have the option of going to Ninja website. The down side of this is the website isn't as intuitive or as good as say, Amazon. If a product part isn't available there is no solution to this other than to call, and even then--that isn't a solution as I'll explain below. So before you buy this really awesome coffee maker here are some cons in making the rather hefty investment (for a coffee maker).1) If you have any need to contact their customer service it is outsourced and very sketchy.  The first time I called it just dropped the line.2) The second call was robotic and I couldn't understand a single thing the man said not just because of an accent, but because the call was riddled with static and feedback. I could hear what I was saying filtered back at me, but any time the man spoke it was distorted. When questioned if they could call back (despite being told I needed to provide my phone number for this) they said they would be unable.4) The man said they would be unable to provide any information on the part as they have no idea when parts will be in. . . The advise was to continue to call in (from what I could make out) or keep looking at the webpage. This doesn't really seem that intuitive or customer friendly system.Possible solution they could make:If Ninja could in the very least add their replacement parts to Amazon or update their own website it could help well avoid having to use their customer support system. However as it stands I wouldn't recommend any Ninja product simply because if you needed spare parts/assistance with your product or warranty aid and had to contact their customer service you might find yourself getting rather flustered. So for now I have a system I can't use, because I can't get support."
"Let me start off by saying I've owned this coffee pot for over two years! This is my second one as my first one broke only a few months of owning it. Make sure you buy the extended warranty if you decide to purchase this one, you're going to need it! I wanted to love this machine mainly because it makes iced coffee and that's all I drink (hot coffee 🤢). It also makes iced lattes which I'm a fan of as well. However, this machine constantly malfunctions! Instead of dripping the coffee in to the cup, it fills up inside the filter piece where you put the coffee grounds in 🤦🏽‍♀️. So now you have to waste more coffee to make another cup of coffee and hope that this time it drips in to the cup (sometimes it takes 3 tries before it drips in to the cup, by this time I'm over it and driving to my local coffee shop!). I'm over this machine, I'm pretty sure it's defective yet again, this shouldn't be happening especially with how much money it costs. I think I'll just switch to a normal coffee pot or possibly a Keurig and just pour the hot coffee over ice (the Ninja iced coffee comes out hot anyway 🤷🏽‍♀️).It's easy to clean except the filter it comes with. I find that my coffee grinds stick to the bottom of it and it's a PITA to clean so I switched to paper filters.My husband drinks hot coffee, sometimes the hot coffee comes out piping hot, sometimes it comes out luke warm. It's a hit or miss.This machine had so much potential and I wish it was as amazing as I first thought it was. All the malfunctions have turned me off and I just want to toss this coffee pot out the window. It's not as great as it's made out to be. Again, make sure you buy the warranty if you're buying this or you will be very disappointed in a couple of months when yours malfunctions and is defective, you'll be out a good chunk of money for a coffee pot!"
"I’ve had this thing only 13 months, and the water tank now leaks more onto my counters than what pours into the carafe.  I can’t find a place to repair it, and it’s not worth $200 a year to buy a new one, so it’s just a loss.  I’ve loved having it, but it simply didn’t hold up."
"I bought this machine for the features. Which all worked nicely and I loved the option for a small cup. However, a year and half into owning it it started leaking from the bottom. This is common with the ninja coffee makers because there are YouTube videos how to fix it. This model was a PAIN to take apart to access the leaking tubing. My husband is very handy and he couldn’t do it. The leaking started out being only once a week and then escalated to every day. We switched to a cheaper coffee maker so if it breaks we aren’t as upset about wasting money."
"If you prefer your codfee hotter than lukewarm you wont enjoy this coffee maker. The carafe doesnt keep coffee warm. Im also doubtful that the function of setting a specific time for the coffee to brew works. On a day to day basis it has a pretty ""meh"" output. A cheapie coffee maker works better."
This product is a very very good product. I love it but mine quit working and now I can't return it. I've had it less than a year when it stopped. It stopped in November.
"I love hot coffee and had a pot warmer on previous coffee pots. This is our first coffee pot with an insulated carafe but it does not keep the coffee hot. The coffee is hot when it is first brewed but is lukewarm in temperature after 1/2 hour. You need to microwave the coffee to have a cup of hot coffee. Second issue is you will notice the bottom of the carafe is wet with coffee. After pouring, there are a few drips that go down the side of the carafe. The drips accumulate on the carafe holder plate. You need to clean the pot holder after each brew. Dripless pours is not rocket science or maybe it is for Ninja engineers."
"Bought this pot because our original ninja pot, which we loved, was old and the timer didn’t work, so we decided let’s get another one like it, but none like it was available any more, so we spent more money on this one.  Big mistake!  The settings and measurements are so quirky that you need to pay close attention so you make the exact amount you want and not what the pot wants.  And there’s no hot plate, so your coffee does not stay hot for long at all and the stainless pot is horrible so you can’t see what’s in the pot.  Just not the best purchase for us.  I’m not saying Ninja is a bad choice, just this coffee system for us. If you have one and figured it out, and love it, God bless you."
"The machine defaults to a half carafe no matter what you do. I haven’t seen this problem in the other one star reviews. I set my size to one coffe cup and as soon as I hit start, it changes itself to half carafe. The first time it happened I didn’t notice and ended up with coffee all over my counter. So now anytime I want a cup of coffee I have to brew A half carafe.  Add to that, the coffee is not very strong even on the rich setting no matter how much coffee you put in. I see lots of complaints about leaks and I haven’t had that yet. I also see a lot of complaints about customer service. If I get a better response I’ll post it hereEdit to add: Amazon customer service suggested I unplug it and plug it back in. Duh. That worked. So now the only issue is, I’d like the coffee stronger. Fingers crossed that this fix works long term."
"I bought this coffee/tea maker as I wanted to create a space in our kitchen to cater to everyone's taste. Hot or cold, tea or coffee, specialty, light to dark roast, this covers it all.I love that it comes with two filter baskets, one for tea and one for coffee. It has so many choices whether your like your drink weak or strong, or somewhere in the middle. While it is relatively easy to use, you should spend some time playing around with it to see all that is has to offer so that you are getting the best brewed cuppa!The water reservoir is convenient and the clean up is easy. I have not yet used the frother, but it does come off for easy clean up.The only bad things I can say about this machine are: 1) the water reservoir is made of thin plastic. I fear that it will crack sooner than later and 2) the carafe does NOT keep the contents warm for more than an hour. My Cuisinart carafe kept my coffee hot for 8 hours; I expected better from Ninja. If they improve the carafe design, I would give it 5 stars, until then, only 3 from me."
"If you like really hot coffee, this Ninja isn't for you.  Temperature is fine at the start, but is barely warm 30 minutes later."
"Makes okay coffee, nothing special and way overpriced. Hard to clean carafe that doesn’t keep coffee warm for long. Definitely should have left this one in the cart"
"I bought this unit in Feb 2022.  It stopped working after 1year of daily use.  The unit would shut itself off once it starts the brew cycle.  They sent me a replacement unit in early 2023 for free since it was under the 1 year warranty.  It’s stopped working again for the same reason again!!  It’s Oct 2024.  Ninja customer service says I’ll need to pay $113 for a replacement base unit.  For a $200 unit, it should last well more than 1 year of use.  If you’re on the fence about purchasing this, buy from another brand."
"Edited to add:The reservoir now leaks almost every time it is used. A LOT. Also the carafe drips and has accumulated coffee in the plastic ring that holds the handle. This, in turn, often drips when pouring. I love being able to make iced coffee and tea at will but good god the design flaws need to be fixed.Pros:Easy to use. Love the scoop on the side! With measurements!GOOD iced tea on demand!GOOD iced coffee on demand!Fits under my cabinets!Cons:Only a 50oz carafe. But I knew this going in and didn’t reduce my rating.However, setting it to brew a full pot only actually brews 3/4 pot. So I have to add more water and brew another small cup to fill it.The carafe doesn’t have a tab to seal it when not pouring. So clumsy people may drip some all they way up to their office on the third floor. Just, ya know, random example.If the water reservoir isn’t seated exactly right it will leak. Not a lot, but it still leaks.Edited to add: Correction, it can leak A LOT. I don’t set it to brew automatically because it brews a pot so quickly (pro!) and you don’t know if it is going to leak the entire reservoir all over the counter and floor when it starts to brew (CON!!)"
"Machine is good, lots of option in sizes of brewing and types of brewing.  The thermal carafe is not so good, does not keep the coffee hot for long at all, the hole on the top of the carafe does not close and stays open (seems like a design flaw), the coffee brewing basket allows some coffee grounds to get through and you end up with lots of grinds on the bottom of your cup, the size of the carafe is small and only brew about 4 avg size cup."
"Stopped working right after warranty. Purchased July 2023- broke December 2025. Stops brewing before completed. Does not used all the water. (Brew a whole pot and it stops after only pulling a small amount of water) Followed all troubleshooting cleaned needle, checked water reservoir, descaled/clean machined and does not work. Waste of money."
"This is my second Ninja coffee maker and I have purchased several as gifts. I love the flavor of my coffee and the frothing feature. I am a fan of all Ninja products and have several different appliances, but 1 1/2 years in and the coffee pot needs to be replaced. It started leaking water from underneath after about a year. We like to prep everything the night before, so we just started leaving the water reservoir on the counter to avoid leaks before morning. (Which means we couldn’t set the timer to have coffee ready when we woke up, however)  Then, it started making a loud noice at the beginning of the brew cycle. After a few minutes, the basket seals to the unit while brewing. Well, something seems misaligned, because it sounds like it’s forcing itself to seal. I’m so disappointed."
"I really liked this coffee maker, but for the price it didn't even last a year!"
"Was a decent coffee maker for the once or twice a week we used it, but it died 2 weeks after the 1 year warranty expired. Now I have to listen to my Mom gloat about how her $25 coffee machine has lasted 4 years."
"This coffee maker is great when it occasionally works properly. However, majority of the time the water backs up and does not drip into the pot. I’ve tried different types of coffee as well as trying disposable filters and nothing seems to help"
Coffee does not stay hot as it is not a carafe. Leaks while pouring. Coffee doesn't taste good. Overall I do not like this system. As return window has closed I had to buy another coffee maker.
I’m having about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of water leaking under the unit. Is there a way to fix this?I do like the unit.
"I've had this coffee maker for about 2 years.  I want to love it but I just can't.  The water reservoir randomly leaks, there is no rhyme or reason as to why, so instead of waking up to fresh brewed coffee you may wake up to find water all over the counters and dripping down the front of your cabinets.  By trial and error I found it seems to not happen as often if I don't fill the reservoir to the maximum water level line.  Now the thermal carafe is leaking between the double-walled design.  When I pour coffee, coffee also comes out around the band and drips down the outside of the coffee cup and on to the counter.  I've been unable to find the replacement carafe on Amazon.  I'm undecided as to whether I'll toss this coffee maker or order a replacement directly from Ninja."
"Eleven Month Owner Report - Downgraded one star.The TEA basket does not empty on any setting other than the two lowest (two small cup sizes). On any size above the lowest two, tea collects in the brew basket and does not drain = you only get a small cup's worth in your cup. Fortunately, I discovered that before I attempted to brew a full or half carafe.  I've pushed all of the levers, made sure everything moves nicely, etc. Called support, had to repeat nearly every detail 3x because of language barrier, and a replacement tea basked is en route. Will update if that makes a difference.First Draft:Pro's - YES it does :: make very good coffee and Tea. Really like the ease of use for the separate baskets. Controls easy to use. It does light up nicely. It does froth reasonably well, but it does not 'steam'. Two baskets are nice and sturdy.Cons - The thermal carafe isn't very thermal. That is a major disappointment. For me, the coffee stays hot the way I like it for 70 to 80 minutes (my wife says I have the hot gene, I like my coffee hot). The removable plastic water canister has the feel that if I bang it to hard against the cabinet I'd be out a canister, machine would be down for a while I get a replacement.  I have had one oddity ... the water does not drain fully, every time, from the TEA basket. Seems very hit/miss, and not common."
I've made tea with this machine so far & it does a good job with that. I haven't had trouble with cleaning the filter & none of my loose-leaf tea has ended up in my cup. I spent the extra $ to get the insulated carafe because I drink tea all morning & like it to be hot. The carafe does not do a good job keeping it warm.I would rate the beverage production at 4 stars & the temperature maintenance at *maybe* 2 stars.
"After paying almost $200 I thought this would be a step up from my previous coffee maker that had a plastic reservoir for holding the coffee. I didn't like the idea of my coffee sitting in plastic so I upgraded to stainless steel.Pro: The carafe is a very nice stainless steel. You can select the amount of coffee you want to brew. I love being able to froth my milk with the side-arm.Con: this machine doesnt allow you to steam your milk. (I knew this before I bought it so I warm milk in the microwave then froth it. There isn't a heating pad for the pot so you can' t keep coffee warm for hours but the pot does a good job holding the heat in for a few.  This doesn't bother me as much because old coffee isn't good coffee so I tend to make mine fresh.Over all, its a good machine but not that much better than the cheaper priced ones.I'm going professional all stainless steel with my next purchase."
"This unit works a lot better than the Keurig Duo Plus that I previously had for a few months.  That unit failed weekly unless you ran vinegar through it after every couple of brewings.This unit has way too many buttons and dials.  What ever happened to keeping things simple?The tray that opens for the coffee/tea grounds stops about a quarter inch too short.  They cut a small opening in the basket because the door doesn't open far enough.  This gets bound up on me every once in a while when rinsing the basket and putting it back it.  Just make the door open a little further and get rid of that dumb little cut out.The water reservoir is poorly designed.  It should be bottom heavy, not top heavy.  Also, make it easier to grip.  Half the time I put the reservoir back on, there is water on the counter.  Almost every other coffee maker out there has a better reservoir design."
"We've used this hot/cold brew system for 4 months now. We switched over from a Keurig coffee maker that allowed for individual servings using your own ground coffee. I read a LOT before purchasing this Ninja coffee maker. I'd like to think I'm the kind of person who thoroughly researches every alternative and makes the best decision on a purchase like this, but alas, you can't win them all - with this one, I failed.(1) The filter mechanism in this machine is flawed, leaving coffee grounds in every cup we make (either single cup or carafe).(2) Probably as a result of the same flaw that causes number 1, the coffee is too strongDespite using 1/4 of the recommended amount of grounds to make the servings, we cannot avoid this problem. I've been a coffee drinker for years, and this is the first machine that literally leaves me nauseated and making repeated bathroom trips for hours after drinking the coffee. Why 4 months? My wife uses this daily and has complained about it since week 1, but she has tolerated it as a good sport. She must have a stronger resistance to caffeine. I drink from a different machine at work Mon-Fri, and until now I've sucked it up on the weekends as well, feeling terrible when I drink from this Ninja coffee maker. Today, I decided to share our story to help balance the reviews. I genuinely do not think this is a 4.5+ star coffee maker. Wishing you all better luck."
Stopped working only after 2 months
"Love the features it has, but does not keep the coffee hot at all.  If you don't pour your cup right after you brew it, you have to heat it up in the microwave.  Not ideal at all."
It's an ok coffee maker.  Lots of features.  Does them all just fine.  The thing that hurts this product is the thermal carafe.  Coffee does not stay warm for long AT ALL.  I even preheat the carafe with hot tap water before making a pot of coffee.  Doesn't really matter.  Coffee is cool within an hour or two.  Old coffee maker that was made by the company name that starts with C and ends with T had a thermal carafe that would keep the coffee hot for hours.  Even after 6 hours it was at least warm.  Not this one.TL/DR Get the version that just has the warming plate with glass carafe and not this thermal carafe.
"This has been my fav coffee maker since we were living with my sister in law and she got me hooked on it. When we moved into our new home, one of the first things on  my list was one of these machines. I love that it makes Tea as well as Coffee! My husband loves the freshly brewed tea too, so it's not just me!My disappointment is in the water reservoir; it has leaked the entire contents over our brand new formica countertop 5+ different times. My sister in law's unit never did this so I thought I must have seated it wrong when I set it the night before the first leak. I've been careful to ensure it was seated correctly each time I refill it, yet I have still had leaks. Now that corner of our counter has swelled and the seam at the edge doesn't meet with the swelled top. Very upset and will be trying to get this resolved with Ninja customer service :("
"I just looked it up to see when we purchased. April, 2022. The previous coffee maker was a Mr Coffee that we'd had for about 8 or 9 years and still worked fine.The basket lock device is failing on this unit. It randomly will kick the basket out when trying to lock or unlock. I just went to make myself a cup and just burned my hand when I pulled the pot out and caught the basket now sitting ajar and spilling hot coffee all over my hand with a basket full of hot water. This has happened repeatedly. Now we're out of warranty and mad that we got rid of the old Mr Coffee pot.Buyer's remorse. Their coffee pot has left a bad taste in my mouth for future Ninja products."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I had this for just over 2 years, using just to brew coffee every other day. It suddenly stopped working. It shows that it is brewing on the display panel but doesn't ever move water ibto the coffee basket. I've cleaned it multiple times with as the Instructions say. The clean cycle will complete and fill the carafe but the water for coffee will not go through"
"Initially I wasn't going to write a review to express my displeasure, but here we are. At first I was annoyed by the lack of a warming plate (I assumed that would be a standard feature on a coffee maker..) and the opaque carafe. However, I saw the carafe was metal when making the purchase, so my fault. I also chalked up the lack of warming plate to buyer error, as I should have read through the product description and double checked (FYI: the 301 model has a warming plate & glass carafe).However, about six months into owning this machine and it has stated to malfunction. When I try brewing coffee, it doesn't produce the quantity it's supposed to produce. I go to brew with the ""XL"" setting and I get 4 ounces of coffee.. that is when it actually spits the coffee out and doesn't simply overflow the brewing/basket area. It's honestly be cheaper to buy a large iced coffee, given the amount of coffee that inevitably gets wasted.This machine is large, taking up quite a bit of space.. and absolutely too much space for a machine that only properly functions half the time. In the end I've resorted to buying a cheaper coffee maker for hot coffee (warming plate, huzzah!), as the metal carafe cannot keep the coffee warm for more than half an hour and I never know if I'm actually going to get the coffee I've set out to brew.Personally, I wouldn't recommend this model; if you want a Ninja brewing system I'd say to go for the 301.. but maybe that one functions as poorly as mine."
"I bought this last summer because I'm a big iced coffee drinker and wanted something that made both hot and cold coffee as well as tea. I didn't start using it to make hot coffee until several months later. Upon brewing hot coffee, I realized this has a major flaw - there is no heating plate and the carafe does not keep it hot after 10 minutes. What?? If you're a fast coffee drinker this probably isn't an issue. But if you like to make a big batch of hot coffee and drink it all morning, this is not the brewer for you. It was too late to return it once I realized this so I kept it but it really annoys me that I have to constantly heat my coffee up in the microwave! For the price I think this is pretty unacceptable. Other than this major downside, everything else is fine - good taste, easy to use and clean."
"This was a great coffee maker for 3 years, however it has recently started leaking from the base. Ninja has stated that it's no longer under warranty so the best they can do is offer a 30% discount to buy the same model new. After paying $250 for a product that is supposed to be top of the line, I'd expect more than 3 years of use. I'm sure there are other options out there that are cheaper, work just as well, and last longer than 3 years."
"Not sure if I am doing wrong here 🤔 coffee doesn’t stay barely warm within 30 minutes? Main reason I bought this, might as well bought a 30$ Walmart Mr Coffee, keeps coffee about as warm. Disappointed for the money, period."
I’ve had it for couple weeks now. I really had a chance to really see what all it can do. The only thing I’ve noticed about this coffee pot is that the coffee doesn’t stay hot enough for me and that’s what I was really looking for is my coffee hot. I mean it does get hot but doesn’t stay hot in the stainless pot. It doesn’t have a burner that keeps your coffee hot. It’s loud. On a scale 1-10 I give it about a 6.
This coffee maker that comes with a stainless carafe does not have a heated element. The carafe is a joke because it does not keep coffee hot for any length of time. The reason I ordered this is because I thought it would keep coffee hot. My son gets up early and makes coffee and thought it would remain hot until his wife would want some. Well not how it is. The maker does not have a heated element.
"The only thing wrong with this coffee maker, it doesn’t make strong coffee."
"This thing does make great coffee. It falls short in the mess department.  The first few times I used it, there were zero drips from the brew pod onto carafe platform. Now, I can count on a few drips every time.  And the carafe pours horribly. The first half pours great, but when it gets lower the pattern gets very wide and unpredictable. I pour my coffee into a vacuum thermos (narrow opening)in the mornings and I have to put a towel down. If you were using a wide cup or travel mug it would probably be fine. Perhaps the glass carafe version would solve this problem. I've tried everything,  even practicing different techniques with water and it just goes crazy at a certain level. Perhaps mine is defective? If you don't like poor design and execution, don't buy this."
"Similar to many of the other low ratings, after a couple of years of usage, the machine started leaking all of the water on to the counter when I use it.  I have made sure I have it firmly locked in but still leaks.  Prior to that, it was a good machine, loved that I could use it for tea and coffee."
"You can’t complain for the price, it works well and is fairly quick. Only downfall is you have to put a lot of coffee grounds to get a normal coffee."
"I have the elite gourmet single serve coffee maker. If you read the full description it says you can make up to 14 oz (comes with a 14 oz tumbler), and you can make grounds, pods, K-Cups. If you read further down it says you can make up to 12 oz and is not compatible with K-Cups. I'm just confused as to which one it is?? Design is small, takes up less space. Brews fine, a little on the slow side. The wide filter makes it easy to clean. All in all, it is a good little coffee brewer. The description just needs cleaned up a little bit! I typically use K-Cups and now I potentially have a whole box I can't use."
"This is the 3rd one I have bought. Took the one I had to work. I will be switching them out. Because the newer one is cheaper. It’s made of cheaper plastic. The cup is no longer aluminum, when you are making the coffee,  water drips down the sides because of the sweat at inside top leak due to lack of seal. All of it because the newer cheaper plastic they are using. Very disappointing. Gave 3 stars bc it works. And the coffee is good. It’s just messier and I know this cup won’t last as long as the other one."
"Pros:1. It makes coffee.2. Decent price.3. Come with a nice mug.4. Small doesn't take up a lot of counter space.5. Reusable filter basket.Cons.1. If you open the top while it's hot, it sprays hot steam at you, even if it's unplugged. Brewing was done and wanted to make second cup and almost got burnt. It was almost like opening the top triggered it to start brewing again. A small amount of really hot water jetted up from heated area, before I added more water to brew the second cup with. Luckily it sprayed up near the back of the unit and not directly toward me.2. Water gets trapped in and under the filter basket, and for some reason under the little basket the filter sits in. This means when you remove them for cleaning and emptying, water runs out onto the coffee maker and the counter it's sitting on.3. Switch feels very cheap, and seems like it wants to break right out of the box.4. There is a light by the switch, but it's really hard to see.5. Switch is hidden on the side near the back of the machine. You can't have anything sitting on the counter next to the coffee maker. Because of con#2 this might kinda be a good thing.Overall it is going to do well enough for the need I have of it.  I only brew a cup or two on weekends now and then. During the week I get my coffee elsewhere. Because I won't be using it often it should do quite well. If your going to use a coffee maker each and every day, i suggest looking for something else. Mainly because the switch feels like it won't last, and it's location is less than spectacular.Update: after owning this coffee maker for a good amount of time. It's still going strong, weak feeling switch still feels cheap and weak and still works.  I make a cup of coffee let everything cool completely after removing the filter basketI carefully invert the coffee maker to pour out all the water. It gets stored on top of a cabinet with the top open to allow it to dry out completely."
"I bought this coffee maker 5 months ago, and it already needs replacing. Stopped running all the water thru. Would have to turn it on again to hear the rest of my water. Disappointing!"
I bought this coffee maker for a cruise. They wouldn't let me bring it into the room but I used it at home and it's a great little coffee maker. I give it three stars because it burns out quickly. This particular one burnt out in 9 months. Stopped making a full cup of coffee and I had to run it a couple of times to complete the job. I ordered a second one because I like strong coffee and you can add as much grounds as you want compared to the k-cup type. That one has burned out after only 4 months. I'm disappointed but it is a lot cheaper than buying Starbucks or Dunkin. I wouldn't recommend for daily use unless you don't mind replacing it
Worked great for a month but then coffee was watery. So returned it after.Also the button to start was on the side and if I pressed it the entire machine moved. So I would have to hold the machine and then press the button.
"Wonderful coffee maker but at exactly ten months the heating element went haywire and started smoking. Used it again next morning and more smoke and the coffee even hotter. Threw it away immediately and bought another. The way I see it, at a cost of $2.50 a month this coffee maker is a steal."
I am not sure yet how to rate it yet because I haven’t tried it yet. I just received it. After opening the box  I’ve noticed that the name on the coffee maker is upside down. Should I be concerned?
"I was looking for something that would let me make a large (14 oz) cup of coffee quickly and easily. This machine definitely does that. HOWEVER, I wonder for how long. It is very flimsily made. Also, when filling, it tends to leak a bit of water out before it starts. It also tends to leak and spit hot water from the lid area. I waited a full minute when the coffee had stopped dripping and it looked safe and when I opened the lid, it spit a bunch of hot water on me. Not too bad; more scary than anything. But I'd be cautious of having this in areas where kids can get to it. I suppose if this were priced at $19 or less, I would give it 4 stars, but at almost $24, it seems a bit overpriced. For a Mr. Coffee, made much better and with a carafe, you'd spend less than $16 on Amazon. I just wanted something smaller, that made a single, large cup of coffee, fast and that wasn't an idiotic Keurig.I don't expect this will last very long. Maybe I will be pleasantly surprised, but I'm already thinking about what I might pick next."
It’s just okay. It serves its purpose but maybe too basic. Very small but works.
Feels like the buttons will stop working any day. Not quality but does the job
"This coffee maker is really compact - too compact, it turns out - none of our travel mugs will work with it.  Granted our favored Contigo mugs are tall (7""), the Thermos brand mugs are 6"" tall - the tallest mug this will accept is 5-1/2"".  It comes with one, so hopefully that won't get lost.  On the other hand, it doesn't take up much counter space.After a few days of use, I dropped a star from my rating and I question the safety of this coffee maker - after it clicked off from brewing a cup of coffee, I let it sit for maybe a minute, then opened the lid.  The ""shower head"" was now facing me and spit a short blast of steam/hot water - nothing lethal, but still startling to say the least.  And overall, I question how well the very-flimsy filter basket will hold up under daily use.  I'll keep this unit for our camper, where it will get occasional use; and I'll reorder another Hamilton Beach.  Our previous HB coffee maker lasted 15 years of daily use before it died."
I bought this for use with single serve coffee pods.  Coffee brews weak and dangerously hot.  There is too much space in the brewing well for water to drain around the filter or coffee basket.  Lid for the travel mug is very thin plastic.  Spend a few dollars more on the Hamilton Beach commercial single serve brewer if you’re using pods.  Coffee tastes far better.
"INSTRUCTION ON AMOUNT OF WATER AND COFFEE SEEMS TO BE OFF A LITTLE3 TABLE SPOONS OF COFFEE- YOU MAY GET SOME GRINDS IN THE CUP.14 OUNCES OF WATER IS OK IT YOU DO NOT NEED TO ADD MILK, OR CREAM.COFFEE DOES NOT STAY  HOT FOR LONG IN MUG."
"It is quite unpleasant to reach the bottom of the cup and have a glop of wet, slimy coffee grounds slide out on one's tongue.Returning it for cash. Not interested in a redux."
"So far I like this item, coffee gets ready in a couple of minutes, setting up for brewing is very easy as far as reliability I can't tell, only had it for a couple of weeksI have to say that customer service is bad, I couldn't get an answer on how to use the senseo pods which this coffee maker is advertised to be compatible with, I almost sent it back.I solved the issue myself by looking up the competition's manual where it was very clear how to use the podsThe interaction with customer service had to be done by email and it takes a couple of days to get an answer, it took several emails back and forth to finally decide it was not worth my time trying any more.."
"Ive tried 3 or 4 different pods and my regular fresh ground coffee and it doesnt matter, the brewer water doesn't get anywhere near hot enough to brew the coffee.  Comes out immediately at 168 (the hottest Ive recorded) but average is 156 F.  All coffee, expect instant which is already brewed, will taste awful if the temp doesnt get near 200 at least.  Waste of money.  Anyone who says this makes a great cup of coffee must love under-extracted, weak brown water."
"For the price it's alright. Easy to use and it gets the job done. However I thought it would be able to fit my typical ""yeti"" style cups and it doesn't. But for the price I just cut out the bottom and made it work.  I would give it 5 stars if I could use all the cups I already own. The cup that comes with it is cheap."
"Price is good, idea is good, but the lid is plastic, cheap and can't seal. You can spilt everywhere. Amazon is flooded with products from some country."
Bought this on Nov 25 and today is Dec 16 ....power button quit working.
"Simple product, works as specified but hot coffee does not stay hot."
"I really like the mug so I am keeping it. Nothing is natural in using this - it was tricky to get the water in - I nearly knock it over pushing the on button. The water flows too fast into a basket type filter which doesn't work for me as I only use one TBLS of coffee and it didn't have time to soak in and release the flavor, so it just tasted weak. In their defense I guess everyone wants great coffee - but instantly. Unfortunately it takes time for coffee to brew if you want really good coffee. Elite I'm sorry but I really don't like anything about it except the mug. I may use it to make instant coffee or hot water for soups. It does heat the water quickly."
"Confession: I drink instant coffee.  I'm coffee-lazy.  (Thanks, I feel better getting that off my chest.)  I thought I might like to try a brewed coffee so I made this low commitment purchase.  As others have mentioned, the heavy metal mug is great.  Some parts of the plastic machine do feel cheap and a bit flimsy.  I am careful with it and don't use it every day.  A regular brew coffee lover would probably want a more substantial machine.  For my occasional use, it's just fine.  I love the compact size."
"There are 2 graphics on this listing. One says the coffeemaker is not compatible with k-cups and one says it is compatible. Unfortunately for me, I only saw the wrong graphic. This coffee maker is only compatible with ground beans - not k cups. Hope this helps!"
"I really like the convenience of the small pot. It has come in handy on our vacation where there was no pot in our hotel room. However, the filter is defective as the screen did not cover the entire bottom of the filter. I had to improvise by using tape to cover the open area so that the grounds did not fall into the cup. It works well until the tape gets wet and falls off. Since I am out of town, I will contact the supplier to get a new filter when I get home. N sense doing it now since I can’t have it shipped here. If that hadn’t happened, I would have given it 5 stars."
"Really wanted to like this, but it’s built defectively. The basket is not wide enough which leaves a gap between the coffee grounds basket and the dropper basket so you end up with coffee grounds in your coffee every time and your left with having to rinse out the whole inside of the machine over your sink every time. Still makes coffee, but with grounds."
I've had the single cup I used about twice a week for 16 months.Last week it stopped turning on. Just doesn't work anymore.
"Bought mid january, seems like a 4-6 month product if you use it with any consistency. I live alone so only need one cup in the mornings, worked solid for three months, then required a double brew for one cup, at this point needs to run five plus times for one full cup. Would only recommend if using sparingly, not worth for consistent use."
"Great concept however, for me the cup was too tall for the device and rubber on the bottom so it catches thus spilling some of the hot coffee on your hand.  It needs more space or a different bottom, then it would be a great product."
I got this July 1st and it's quit working already
"Bought this little coffee maker in August of 2022 and was just complimenting it yesterday morning (mistake) as it quit working this morning June 12, 2023. LOL The On/Off switch will not engage when depressed? Our great little coffee maker (which we loved) is DOA after only ten months of careful, gentle use. These DISPOSABLE products from China are getting quite monotonous. Bring back ""Made in America"" and things that are made to last. Please..."
Wanted a nonbreakable coffee mug that I could make the coffee in and take it to go with me. Single use. I used it the first two times and I was kicking myself for not getting one sooner for it fit all my needs and wants. Since the third time I’ve used it the water runs out the bottom before coffee is made. The travel mug only fills halfway up with coffee. The coffee is filled with nasty coffee grounds so much so you cannot drink it. Very disappointing
Cheap plastic.  Button is super cheap and will break with continued use. It won't take the k-cups but that's livable since I really hate putting those things in the trash. The coffee tastes different. Some of the grounds don't even get wet. It drips way too fast to make good coffee.
"Unfortunately the ad for their web site says  its kcup compatible it is not,no piercing needles,then they want to give me the run around on their mistake,effing hassle these people put me through,to return their mistake,mind you im disable that's why I order to deliver,terrible ,terrible customer service,I pay the subscription,and barely use it,and they couldn't get this return done!!"
"I think I was expecting too much out of this item based on the reviews and the looks from pictures. It is of very cheap quality (very thin, eat to break plastic). It works well but the brew is not as strong as it should be. The cup is decent, hold it hot long enough to take with you to work."
"I returned the item WITHOUT using it, because it was A LOT larger than it appeared to be, and was too big to consider packing in a suitcase."
"Very use to use and clean, BUT… the standard reusable filter probably spoils the taste of coffee to the extent that I am not going to use this anymore"
The unit I received does not contain any part that could hold a k-pod.  The brew filter screen is much too large to hold a pod and there is no needle to puncture a k-pod.  Either my shipment was missing parts or the description for this item is incorrect.
"I liked this product as it had the to go container with it. Unfortunately, coffee grinds go into the cup. So I tried another filter cut to the bottom, which helped, but if not cut well, it still leaked the coffee grinds. I guess I am tired of the grinds, so I am trying another one instead."
"I never even got a chance to try it out. Straight out of the box it was dead; power light didn't go on, didn't even get luke warm never mind heat at all. It is very cheaply made and this company has nerve to charge such a high price. I'm glad it worked for others, but the one I got was DOA. I'm really angry about this. I wanted and needed this so much. Now, I have to go through the whole headache of a return and waiting, waiting, waiting for another brand model to get here. REALLY unhappy about this!!! Pure plastic junk!!PS When reading other coffee maker reviews, someone mentioned ""percolator"" and I remembered I had my Grans small one in the back of the cupboard. I'm going to try this and save myself a lot of grief and money. These  (Asian) coffee makers aren't rocket science and you'd think they'd want to do a better job of it, but, no, they want to loot and abuse us any way they can. Well, too bad. Now I'm not going to buy any at all; the can keep their plastic junk."
POOR QUALITY NO WONDER IT WAS CHEAP. GAVE IT AWAY. THE STAINLESS STEEL MATERIAL IS NOT GOOD.
Product did not function! Box open upon arrival
"It was a great product while it lasted.... It was my first coffee machine I ever own and use, but my experience didn't last long. It was so easy to use; just put your coffee product in the filter and water and BOOM! I loved it so much and good for me since I work in early mornings. Hard to get up sometimes, this helped me make the coffee experience so much better! But sadly, it broken down after 4 uses!!!!! I'm not mad tbh more like disappointed and i try to fix the issue by myself but no luck. The machine just turns off after like 10 seconds when i pushed the button. I don't know why it does that but seems like it broken to me."
Have bought one that lasted me over a year and still works.  Bought another one and it stopped working after first used.
It’s easy to use and clean.  The only improvement I’d like to see is my Dads coffee cup being replaced.
Sent back
Only option very small paper filters from other vendors
"The machine works fine, it's definitely not the best quality but it serves its purpose.The mug, however, is absolutely terrible. I've spilt coffee on myself way too many times. If you plan on not travelling with the mug, it should be fine, otherwise, it will spill easily. I now use another travel mug."
This is not what was shown. It is very cheaply made.
.weeks 2 after broke one 1st1 The
"The product is very light weight and is made of cheap plastic. The power button is hard to deal with, wish it was more friendly.On another note, the mug quality is very good, and most importantly it is a healthy choice since it is all stainless steal inside."
"I used to think that people who called coffee ""bad"" were just being snobbish. To me most coffee I've had was never different enough to be called bad. But the drink produced by this item is really bad. I have been using the same ground coffee for years, brewed in a little stovetop maker. I wanted something that required less effort. I put the same amount of coffee in this brewer. Based on the flavor, I'd argue that this did not brew the coffee. It tasted like someone had washed the grounds with cold water. It didn't even smell like coffee even when held up to my face. Good coffee has the whole kitchen smelling like that beautiful coffee smell. I'm disappointed."
Loved it ..quit working and just got mid January.... don't waste your money it's a hunk of junk
Works ok for the money. All good but the consistency of the taste varies day to day. You get what you pay for
"You get what you pay for.The power button doesn't work to turn off, so you have to unplug it, and even after it's unplugged it will keep dripping for a minute, so you have to leave your cup there or make a mess. So make sure you put in the exact right amount of water for the cup you are filling or it will likely overflow. I knew it was going to be cheap, but if was just slightly more functional it would be a lot better. Still, it makes coffee and hot water."
"You have to unplug the coffee maker after you use or the heating element will stay on although at a very low setting. We left it plugged in overnight and it doesn't work any more. I gave the ""Easy to use"" 3 stars for this feature. Going to buy a four pot coffee maker instead."
Coffee pot works great but it is frustrating to have to use a filter because the reusable filter has a hole. I wish there was a way to get just the basket.
"The filter ripped and has a hole that leaks coffee grinds into the cup. I'm not sure if the filter was already ripped or it ripped while using it but the replacement filter costs $8.90. I paid $9.99 for the whole machine in January 2023 so less than 3 months of use.I am not able to return the product and the manufacturer will not replace the filter...""Thank you for contacting us! We do apologize, broken/damaged parts have a warranty of 30 days from the purchase date.If your product is out of warranty, we can still help. We have parts available for purchase, for the part you are requesting which is the Mesh Filter, the cost is $8.90 including shipping."""
I specifically selected this coffee maker because of it's advertised 600 watt usage label because I wish to use a battery AC unit that has a 600 watt max limitation.  Opened up the unit and it has 700 Watts stamped on the bottom...it tripped my battery and will thus not be useful to me.  PLEASE advertise your product accurately!!
"The first product was returned because of a non-functioning on/off button. The second one works just fine. However, for $30 I would expect something a little more substantial. All plastic and lightweight is just fine but flimsy. The cup is NOT insulated and the water does not come out as hot as my electric water kettle. I would not buy this again and should have just returned the second one too, but I guess I'm just too lazy."
"This is very easy to use and clean up, but your coffee isn't hot. Unless you drink it within the first 2 minutes out of the coffee maker you have lukewarm coffee. Nasty"
"Purchased in Dec 2021, stopped working in July 2022.  Only makes half a cup or so, then turns off. This little machine made amazing coffee for 7 months, and then just stopped working properly. I took very good care of it, always followed the instructions, etc. Don't regret buying it as I enjoyed it thoroughly. Just disappointed it was for a limited time."
The machine cuts off before all the water is drained out and I have to restart 2-3 times to get the full cup.
"When I first got this coffeemaker it worked great. Now, two months and $25 later, it shuts off, leaks inside and under pot and I can't return it for refund. I will never buy this product again. It was regularly cleaned."
"When I got the coffee pot, I like the way it look, was easy to used!  The second day, I went to used it. It did  not work!  I call Amazon and got a customer service person, who was hard to understand, I believe he had the same problem with me!  Finally we set up a date for UPS to pick up and to get my refund!  Now Amazon screw me on the refund!  I am prime member!  I paid $31.oo for the machine!  I am only getting $23.oo dollars back!  I am not a happy person!"
"After several rinsing, and several cups of brew, coffee still tasted like plastic.  Too bad, perfect size and easy to use.  Same quality as my 12 year old age Alia 4 cup which still works."
I bought this and loved it so much so I bought a second one when I received the second one the first one just quit working the button just won’t come on. The second one I ordered the same thing happened within a month 🤬
"Very, very weak coffee, even when two huge scoops of coffee grounds which are barely soaked; almost dry."
It makes a good cup of coffee but not a full cup of coffee the coffee that's in sewing machine it's only about three-quarters full heated water in the in the pot but it just won't reach
I have no idea if the person I gifted it to liked it or not.
"Coffee brewing strangely , very noisy spewing  water brrrr brrr brrrr whole time and i put 8 oz water and put full coffee in the basket to make rich full flavor,  but after making 4oz coffee and coffee stop making it , and auto shut off. i open up and saw half of water is still in the reservoir. I have to flip over coffee machine to throw away water in the reservoir.  If i put 10 oz water then still making 4oz coffee and remain water was still in the reservoir. Looks like It defect it"
"I like the mug . Perfect for travel, going to work ."
Power button broke. Wouldn't turn on.  Another POS from China. Barely lasted 6 months...
It states in the description: BREW K-CUPS OR GROUNDS: Brew a cup of coffee exactly how you want it with convenient versatility to select between K-Cup Pods or fresh coffee grounds. Includes reusable filter for use with coffee grounds and even loose-leaf tea.  False advertising ... There is nothing in the manual about a K-Cup Pod......... Amazon should remove this item!
"Somewhere in the description, this says it is compatible with both K-cups and ground coffee. This is not accurate! It works for ground coffee only. The filter for ground coffee does work pretty well, and I am happy with that feature....but not pleased that if and when I may want the convenience of a K-cup, I don't have it, though it was advertised that way."
Very cheaply made. I was attempting to replace a Capresse coffee maker that I’ve had for years and this coffee maker doesn’t even compare.
This coffee pot burned out the first week I owned it when I forgot to add water. My research says that better quality coffee pots have a sensor that does not allow the unit to heat at all if no water is in the reservoir. This is poor quality but I guess you get what you pay for.
This was intended for the office but was tested on arrival at home.  It would not power on.  The product felt flimsy.  I returned and purchased a different product.  Do not recommend it.
"I bought it as a gift for a friend but he didn’t tell me till three months later that it does not work so would’ve been nice to be able to exchange it within the 30 days, that should work for at least a year warranty for a year, oh well, now I know"
But choose we get it my wife leave it on the bed and have to go to work and the dog to the court off of it
"This is the perfect appliance to make loose leaf tea. It is so easy! I've been using it daily for months with no issues. Good value.** Update  - it stopped cycling through all the water in 6 months. I've cleaned it multiple times. Works great, but didn't last at all. Bummed."
Even the link for the manual on the manufacturer's website fails.
Works great but basket filter was messed up and caused coffee grounds to go into my cup
"I opened this and found that the power button had fallen off. I gently replaced it and it was turned ""on,"" with no way to turn it ""off"" except to unplug it. I plugged it back in to make a cup of coffee. Noticed that the included ""insulated"" cup was very thin. Coffee was ok. Cleaned it, tried to make another cup of coffee, and the power button would not turn ""on.""  Returned it today.  Cheap, nonfunctional. I'm going to find one that costs a bit more, and maybe it will work more than once (fingers crossed)."
"Yay, way to waste my time."
I returned this item because the filter basket leaked on first use and allowed coffee grounds to flow into the cup.
"All in all, we liked this machine.  However, the recent failure is inexcusable because it is not useless.  We have kept it clean.  Over the past month or so, it has failed to pump completely the water placed in the tank.  I would suggest that this is the makings of a pump failure.  Since the item was bought in August 2022, the longevity of the product that I received is POOR.  Caveat emptor!"
Very cheaply made not near as sturdy as our mr. coffee. Extremely light weight. Makes a decent cup of coffee but not great.
"Just what I needed, my long time coffee maker broke and this was perfect. Makes a single cup quickly and is a travel mug. My husband and I like our coffee different strengths so we each a quick cup each AM. Also takes up little space on counter"
"Not even a daily coffee drinker and this machine stopped working after 6 weeks. It simply won't turn on, feels like there is something wrong with the ON button. It wasn't too expensive, but I probably only made around 20 cups of coffee before it gave out. Major disappointment"
"so very cheaply made, like a cheap child's toy!  i would not put anything hot in this particular plastic.  i do not know what the metal of the cup is, but it does not look like ANY stainless steel that i have ever seen, so i can not trust that metal to put my hot drink in either.  it is way overpriced for what it is!  if it were FREE i would still NOT use it.  i have to return it i am sorry to say.  waiting on help from my grandson for the returning.  sighhhh ... so disappointed."
Save your money. It died after three months and the flavor of the coffee wasn't that great.
very cheaply made
"Received this & never opened cause it was a gift.  Once opened up looked very much used with grind dust & on top of that did not work what so ever.  They send a trouble shoot email that doesn't do anything.  Won't even just send me another one, not asking for refund just a replacement of money I spent on an item that can not be used.Do not order from this brand what so ever"
Worked great until it stopped working after four months. The on/off button stopped clicking.
Too slow for me.
the design and function is fine. The unit works well but the coffee machine and coffee have a distinct plastic smell and taste that both my wife and I detected. It is very off putting so we are going to return the item. Pity since I liked the unit in every other way.
The coffee maker itself is pretty nice but the handle on the pot is hollow and cheap. It came broken but it was only a minor inconvenience so I didn't say anything. The other side of the handle is now broken. That is only from daily use. I probably would not buy this coffee maker again because of the pot. A replacement for this thing is quite expensive.
"The cup measurements are printed on one side of the pot only making it awkward to see how full it is. Pouring coffee into a cup is awkward because the lid flops down blocking vision for seeing how full the cup is.  The pot collects coffee stains far faster than past pots I've had so I end up washing it out far more often. Otherwise, it works fine."
"This 14 cup Mr. Coffee machine makes great coffee. Minor issue, cleaning the coffee pot is a bit problematic. Major issue, the filter is flimsy and will probably need to be replaced very soon. The problem, I can't find the proper sized filter. I've contacted ""Mr. Coffee"" on line and so far no response. I don't want to use paper filters.FOLLOW UP: I just got off the phone with Mr. Coffee. Seems while it's their ""pot"", (a new big 14 cup size), they don't have spare metal filters you can buy. The rep told me I could go to Walmart and buy a filter but it's the wrong size. Thus I had to return the ""defective"" pot to Amazon, stay away from this product."
"Doesn't brew to the amount expected. If we fill the reservoir to 10 cups, we get about 9-91/2 cups. We basically have to add at least a full cup of water extra to get the amount in the decanter we want. Not sure why there's such a significant difference. Especially when it's supposed to be a 14 cup coffee maker. You won't get 14 cups if you fill it to that amount, and you can't fill above that amount because it will overflow the reservoir. Other than that, it works fine and brews a decent cup of coffee."
"I've had many Mr. Coffee pots over my 73 years and this one is my disappointment. It makes great coffee however, getting the water into the assigned place is a pain. you have to work around the water dispensing system they have glued to the lid. Not enough space to pour in the water without 1) pilling out the unit from under a cabinet AND having to turn it sideways to maneuver the coffee pot into a position where all the water will pour out and 2) they give you a coffee grounds basket but who wants to clean that out every day, so I added a coffee filter....and a regular coffee filter will not catch all the grounds so you have to clean out the provided basket anyway. so I ordered commercial size 9 1/2"" across flat, threw out the basket and it is a much better solution.  Had I known about these two issues I would have sent back. unfortunately I was so excited about a new coffee system, I immediately unpacked and threw away the old one in the box the new one came in & immediately took to the dumpster. well, all this said it is better than the 'famous' name one it replaced that dumped water and coffee on the counter every day because of a ill designed coffee pot. Hope this helps.....and Mr. Coffee reads this."
"Supposedly all black plastic is made from recycled electronics and has funky chemicals in it.  I ran a few pots of water through this thing to clean it, and it really, really stunk of plastic.  Even after putting a few pots of coffee through it, it still has a strong plastic smell.  As a coffee maker, this thing works great.  The plastic smell is a big turn off though.  It would be amazing if someone made a drip coffee maker with zero plastic.  Maybe one day."
The coffee brewed isn't strong enough for my taste even with the strong coffee tab
"This coffee maker works well and that's not the issue. The issue is that the carafe is delicate and after 3 month it broke.  Replacement on amazon cost me 36.00!  No one else carries it, not even online at mrcoffee.com.  Plenty of comments on their website on people not able to replace."
THE SPOUT ON THE DECANTER IS TO WIDE TO EASILY FILL A THERMOS IT DOES NOT MAKE GOOD STRONG COFFEE W/O OVER FLOWING THE BASKET OR FILTER IT HEATS THE WATER GREAT BUT THE COFFEE MAKER DOES NOT LET THE HOT WATER PASS SLOWLY ENOUGH TO GET TH E OUT OF YOUR COFFEE I USE ESPRESSO IN MINE AND I HAVE TO PULL THE DECANTER OUT AND LET IT FILL THE FILTER AND PUT IT BACK IN WHEN FULL AND BECAUSE IT MADE FOR MAKING FAST WEAK COFFEE I HAVE TO REPEAT THE PROCESS UNTIL DONE IT'S NOT WORTH 70 BUCKS IT'S ALSO AT WALLYWORLD FO 50 BUCKS
I bought this to replace one where I broke the carafe. This one has a basket shaped filter. I don’t think it makes as flavorful coffee as a cone shaped filter. It takes at least 2 more scoops to get the same flavor. I like my coffee strong so that really makes a big difference & makes coffee more expensive to make with this type filter. Other than that it works great!
"I've had this thing a couple of weeks and if it wasn't such a pain I'd return it.I like to ""brew later"" so that there is a pot full by the time we get up. While I set it for an hour before our usual time to get up, this thing won't allow you to sleep in. It not only sounds like a dying steam engine, but the sound of the coffee trickling into the glass carafe echoes of the walls.Unless this is on another floor of your house or you want a coffee maker that doubles as a alarm clock, look else where."
It worked fantastic until exactly 9 months after purchase. The machine went and stayed on 24/7 I came home from work to find the entire machine scorching hot. The hot plate and the brewing heating element were both at max temp... Could have easily caught fire.
"Replacing an older and what I thought was lesser maker with this, horrid overpriced 90s remake garbage.Dont buy it, Black Friday rip off. Losing hope for Amazon altogether!"
The shape of the coffee pot always spills when you are transferring the liquid . Frustrating
"Seems to not filter coffee, grinds get into pot. Not as good as my old Mr Coffee 😡"
"I needed to replace my coffeemaker with a more inexpensive product; That is why I chose Mr.Coffee. However, I needed to buy new kinds of filters. The top opened with difficulty and did not stay closed when pouring! I gave it away and bought a Cuisinart!"
"After only 4 months of use, it will no longer shut off at all unless you unplug it."
I have always used Mr. Coffee but this last one keeps shutting off after 2 hours. Being a coffee lover this is making me look else where.
"Bought in January 2024, only had it 9 months. Now it just starts heating up on its own without pressing the “brew now” button. Definitely a fire hazard. Do not recommend"
Recieved May 25 2024 died on September 17 2024.  Four months of great coffee.  So basically $20.00 a month.  The matching isn't mathing.
I had to order a replacement after my first one suddenly died. It worked in the morning and after work it was dead. I had it plugged into a huge protector.I usually have no problems with this brand.
"It takes forever to brew. The ""clean"" signal stays on, even though I cleaned the filter. I have no idea how to order these filters that need to be changed every month. I feel like a patsy that was lurered into thinking this would be great. Sadly, I was So wrong! Soon, I will do more research and not buy through Amazon. 😬Be ware, no instuctions came with my purchase and I even went on line for help! Byer, Be Ware!!"
"I've been using Mr Coffee makers since the early 70's, I just bought this one and I am shocked. It is the cheapest piece of junk, I am so shocked. They spent more money on engineering the box, than they did on this Coffee maker. The coffee grind holder doesn't sit flat on the counter anymore like the previous machines! The lid doesn't sit flat when it is closed, because the spring on the valve at the bottom of the coffee grind filter holder has too much pressure. When adding water it is anything but easy, because they have very poor design of the shape of their machine. Seems like some little kid engineered this machine, and the nerve of them to have charged me over seventy dollars for it, SMH. And not to mention it is extremely cheaply made! Hang your head Mr so-called, Mr Coffee, You should be ashamed of yourself! The machine I had to throw out, blows this piece of crap out of the water, by far. You used to make such nice Coffee machines! Never again! I am sending it back, If I knew it was made this way, I wouldn't even pay 20.00 for it."
"First off, I want to say I used this coffee maker for months and loved it. I had no issues for about 5 months.And then I had a scary issue - not merely an inconvenience. One day, I brewed a pot like usual and when it was done, I turned the pot off. I didn’t think anything of it all day. I came back many hours later to realize the pot never turned off and the hot plate had been hot all day. Thank god I still had liquid in the carafe. Now I have to unplug the coffee maker every time I’m done using it or else it will never shut off. This seems like a scary fire risk.Customer service was helpful and responsive and wanted to send me a replacement pot but I don’t want it. It’s not worth the risk of setting my house on fire. Until they recall all of these, consider another pot."
"It's a good coffee maker, unfortunately it makes an awful beeping sound when it's finished brewing. Enough to ruin an otherwise peaceful morning."
"This coffee maker is fine, however it seems like the manufacturer is cutting costs like everyone else. The coffee is staining the glass carafe and the coffee strainer. I’ve never had that issue before. The materials used appear to be cheaper."
The maker did not finish the brew cycle.  Had to return it for replacement. The 2nd one works OK but it's not what I expected from Mr Coffee. I would try something else if I was doing it over.
"Sunbeam makes these... ""Mr. Coffee"" really isn't a brand anymore. This one was brand new and failed on first use. Filled it with 12 ""cups"" water. Brews fine until about 9 or 10 cups. Then it starts to pop, gurgle, and steam away all the rest of the water over the course of 10-15 minutes. The popping and clunking will only stop when the water tank is actually empty.This is a common failure mode for these. Returned to amazon. Big waste of time, time to find a new brand."
bought the coffee 10/11/23 on 10/9/24 it goes brain dead and just steams the water out. Caution if you try and add more water beware of the steam you will get burned it is that hot! This unit was unplugged the first six months and only used a couple of weeks one or two days at a time to start until that house was sold than plugged in and used daily and now it is e-waist. I will not buy this product again plus having to replace the overpriced and hard to find pot.
"Do not buy! We returned it.  It produces so much steam, half the water evaporates and you get two cups of coffee instead of ten. The steam wasn’t good for my wood cabinets.  Have no idea why this worked this way. Mr coffee is usually a brand we trust, but this was a lemon!"
"DO NOT buy this coffee pot if you want to make more than 8-10 cups!!  It has a 14 cup pot but the basket is the same size as a 10 cup coffee maker and the filter overflows if you try to make a full pot.  Also, it actually brews 2 cups less coffee than the amount of water you put in.Not happy."
"No, manual, no instructions,  nothing to identify the parts. Press the buttons,  they do nothing.  Very slow to make a pot.  Took about 14 minutes for 14  cups. But coffee was hot and tasted ok."
"We loved this coffee maker for 5 months. The warmer never shut off when the 4 hour timer shut off. The light shut off, appearing to be shut down. We got home from work and found it still hot and coffee scorched to the pot. We unplugged it overnight and when my husband plugged it in this morning he didnt turn it on, just plugged it in when he poured the water in it started brewing before he turned it on!! Not worth the worry, we will be spending the extra money on a more reliable machine!!"
"We filled the carafe with 14 cups of water and pressed the brew now button to do an initial clean out brew (no coffee grounds). After an hour of brewing it was still spitting and sputtering and only 7 cups had brewed (per the measurements on the outside of the carafe). We had to unplug it to get it to stop brewing. We thought maybe it was the reusable filter basket or maybe we missed a piece of packaging. So, we let it cool, took everything out looking for any missed tape or packing materials. Nothing. I refilled the carafe to try again. After 20 minutes of brewing the signal chimed and it was still brewing. Only 6 cups of the 13 cups poured into the machine brewed. Will be returning."
"It's really just a 12 cup maker with a larger pot and filling area. The coffee basket isn't bigger than a 12 cup, so if you put more grounds in there it might overflow.Worst thing is the buttons started not working and sometimes coffee leaked. I returned it and got a different brand."
"When I received coffee maker, I took it out of box, and the handle was broken. It is useable but I  didn’t approve of a product that was damaged."
"Purchased this Mr  Coffee coffee maker BVMC-PC14 BL2, 14 cup on July 28, 2024. Worked great, right up to October 5, 2024. To brew, just plug it in. To turn it off, I must unplug it from the wall. I see Rachael has the same issue. REMEMBER TO UNPLUG IT BEFORE LEAVING THE HOUSE."
Arrived today- not in an Amazon box just in the manufacturer’s box. Looks beautiful! It was to replace my Ninja Coffee machine that leaks when you put water in it. I was so hopeful that switching back to Mr. Coffee brand would solve my issue of leaking but no!  Right out the box 1st time putting water in it to clean it and water comes pouring out the bottom. There’s holes in the bottom! Why? Water going everywhere. I’m very disappointed. No I didn’t overfill it and yes the coffee filter holder was in place. Now I have to box it back up and return it! What a hassle. Very disappointed
"I purchased this coffee maker in Feb. 2024 and it failed on Oct. 6, 2024.  It would not shut off which could be a fire hazard! A $69.95 Mr. Coffee was a waste of money..."
This won't turn off even if the light shows it off.  I have to unplug it so the timer doesn't work either.  Awful!  May be a fire hazard!  Good thing I caught before it burned the coffee up!
The clock looses about 1 minute every 2 hours. The clock is unusable.  I have never heard of a digital clock not keeping time.  I have a 150 year old wall.clock that kepps better time
"Easy to program and makes good coffee, but the ""ready"" alarm is loud and can't be disabled, which is really irritating. Will spend more for the Cuisinart that can be disabled next time."
"The control panel became stuck on Brew setting, so the product was overheating and burning up coffee unless the coffee maker was unplugged. Amazon would not take the return after 4 months, so I had to go through 45 minute phone call with Newell Brands who will refund the product cost but not the taxes paid on the coffee maker. Refund will occur about a month after I send the Mr. Coffee back to Newell Brands."
This is about our fourth Mr Coffee machine and have never had a problem.  This one sounds like a cement mixer and takes 20 minutes to brew only half the water you put in it!  We should've kept our old ugly one that worked like a charm.  Would NOT recommend!
"This is identical to the previous coffee pot we used for years. This one has a design flaw and holds water in the plastic around the too of the carafe. We would have returned it, but would have been without for days during an exchange. Meanwhile I use a towel to catch leaking water when pouring. We gave the original pot 5 stars."
Amazon set this coffee pot with a dirty basket no filters no user manual and when you plug it in it won’t boil the water and make any coffee. How can you sell crap like this when I try to return it there’s no option for replacement.
The keep warm function on this coffee maker is unadjustable. It will infuse a wonderful burnt bitter taste if left on keep warm for more than 5 min. My workaround for now is to try and shut it off immediately following the complete charm.So if you want to add a bold bitter taste to your coffee thia machine is definitely for you.
Cannot use
The brew now button stopped working properly. Would have returned it but it was past the window.
Woke up in the middle of the nite it smelled like coffee.  Button  not turned on but coffee was very hot. Glad there was still coffee in pot who knows what would have happened.  Unplugged.  Plugged back in next morning started brewing without on button pushed.  Beware could start a fire
Spent $80 for a Father’s Day gift. My husband just opened it this past weekend and found it in pieces. And now too late to return 😭
"The coffee maker itself was great. But replacement carafes are NOT available. Not sold separately, out of stock, I saw both reasons on their website responding to customer service complaints. So, buyer beware. If you purchase this, you’ll be out an entire $70 coffee maker if you happen to crack or break the carafe. I’ve had Mr. Coffee makers for years, but this will be my last one. Cuisinart makes a 14-cup maker and *they* make replacement carafes available to their customers."
Woke up one morning and just wouldn’t start. Lasted only one week. Did all the troubleshooting. Before that coffee was made with lots of coffee grinds. Would not recommend. Would give a 0.
"I should have sent this coffee maker back. I put in 10 cups of water, but only 8 cups would brew. This morning it wouldn’t brew at all. It just kept steaming. I would not recommend."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Comes with a basket. Thought that was the issue. Bought paper filters. Same results. Makes espresso perfectly. But I want a nice cup of coffee. So frustrating Mr. Coffee got this one wrong.
"Carafe is so cheap it always cracks along bottom metal band. So many have to be replaced, they are on back order, you cant find one."
"Bought September 3rd and received it September 7th 2023 but died on February 28, 2024… got a good 4-1/2 months use. So how do I get my $70.00 dollars back? Guess I should have bought the 4 year protection plan. Garbage."
I bought this coffee maker 34 days ago or so and it’s completely broken. I’m out $64 dollars. I would not recommend you waste your money.
Soon as its plugged in it starts heating up and its hot! You can hit the switches all day long and it wont shut off!! Says on the box thanks for giving it a second life....What??? I never ordered a reconditioned coffeemaker!!!
For the price I expected and new in box product. Without the instructions I don’t know how to get the bottom off to get the cord or how to program the coffee maker. Very disappointed.
This was the second 14 cup Mr Coffee purchased.  The first arrived damaged and the second stopped working 4 days past the return date.  We’ve had Mr Coffee’s for 20 years and this is the worst model made.  Cannot and will not recommend this model.
"Was super excited for this coffee pot. However after the second time brewing, just water, it quit brewing. I unplugged over night everything to reset it and it just stopped brewing. Will be returning."
The coffee maker quit working after 3 months
I used the coffee maker 3 times and the top of the pot has a large crack now. Cannot find a replacement anywhere! I am pissed off!!
"The coffee maker water reservoir is hard to fill because there isn't much room to pour water into it. The coffee ""basket"" takes up much of the area. Soon after the warranty ran out, the coffee maker failed to auto shut off, which is a fire hazard. We googled how to reset the maker, but no luck. Wouldn't buy again."
Brewed hot water! Coffee grounds never even got wet. All they sell is total garbage anymore. Will be returning!
When you get a cup of coffee and put sugar and milk in it shouldn’t be lukewarm
Pot stop working 4 months old
"As a general observation, we have owned manyl Mr Coffees over the years. In recent years they perform well but stop brewing after one to two years. Our current one has just expired after 1 1/2 years. We will never purchase another Mr Coffee. I don't hold much hope to find any more reliable ones however."
"I thought I did something wrong., woke up to find the coffee maker in clean mode. The entire machine was super hot. Made coffee for the morning, turned off the machine before leaving the house. Came back to find the pot bottom scorched. No indicator lights on, just super hot because it never shut off. JUNK It’s less than 1 year old. Save your money and your house, look elsewhere."
"I should’ve read the 1 star reviews before I bought this. Brand new out of the box and I made a pot of coffee. Real nice lid that doesn’t leak steam, but it didn’t turn off afterwards. It got to its 4 hour warm limit and just stayed on. I unplugged it and left it for a few hours and plugged it back in. It started heating up again without any buttons pushed or lights on. This machine is a FIRE HAZARD!!!I had to unplug it to even leave the house. I sent it back the next day. Do NOT buy this piece of junk unless you’re trying to burn your house down."
2 coffee makers later. This will get returned. I think I will go to a different brand name. After about a month of use it continues to stay hot even when the light goes off. We have to unplug it. Hmm. It’s not good
If you need a replacement carafe there is none available.  They do not have a replacement.  So the coffee maker is a waste of money.  I threw it in the garbage!!!!
"This coffee maker will randomly turn itself on. Did it tonight when we were gone. Coffee was scorched in the pot. And no matter what buttons we push, we can’t get it to turn off unless we unplug it. I was so excited to get a 14 cup coffee pot, but this is a fire hazard."
"**Update to 1 star** - Began using this maker in early Aug 2023 and as of Dec 20th it has failed. It turns on, but you press the brew button and the light turns on but does not brew. Disassembled to investigate the problem and saw nothing obvious. I did smell a slight burnt odor on the control circuit board, so maybe something failed there. It wasn't hardwater this time!Experienced coffee maker buyer here. Over my life time I have probably purchased 2 dozen coffee makers. Mine all seem to fail in the same way - hard water. 9/10 times this is how they have broken. This is my PSA for all newbies to the maker game.....get a water softener if you have hard water and fill your maker with filtered, softened water.Now about this maker - pros: comes with reusable grind cup. no more paper filters. Easy to use buttons that are simple to understand. Programable for those that want that warm coffee smell hitting their nose right before they wake up. Large pot for those that need a lot of natures go juice.Cons: The power cord was jammed into a small ""holding area"" in the back and took us maybe 10-15 minutes to figure out how to get it out. I am sure this is good for shipping and storage, but sure makes setup difficult. This unit is quite large, it is much taller than other simple makers I have had. Plan plenty of counter space and if you put it under cabinets, be prepared to have to pull it out to fill the water reservoir.Lastly, the one I ordered came with a plastic chunk broken out of the ring where the pot sits. This in no way effects the usage of the device, but esthetically looks damaged. I can't see how this would have happened during shipping, so it must have come from the factory this way. So the quality assurance might not be that great on this product. BUT, I am only a week into using this and so far so good.Final thoughts: If you want a simple maker that last forever, go get you a $500 BUN maker. If you don't mind replacing your maker every 2-3 years, keep it cheap and simple. And this unit fits that bill.Happy brewing."
"Large capacity is the biggest selling point for this coffee maker, in fact, I've never seen a 14 cup before, only 12.  This isn't a compact machine, but considering the size of the carafe, it probably couldn't be all that much smaller.  There are a lot of features/settings on this one, which means a lot of buttons , and honestly, less would be more here, simplicity is a nice feature in a coffee maker.  The power cord is stored in a cavity in the back, and once you fish it out, you realize it isn't very long.  It worked for me, but I could see it being an issue for some.  In terms of brewing coffee it is average.  Good temperature, average speed, although I found using anything other than ""strong brew"" produced weak coffee.  If you need a large brew, this coffee maker is good enough, but if 14 is more than you need, shop around the many 10-12 cup coffee makers."
"My regular Cuisinart 12-cup programmable coffee maker is still going strong, but having a backup for the basement kitchen was a no-brainer.This has all the features needed, brews a great cup of coffee and is easy to use and clean.  A great price for a product similar in features to a more expensive Cuisinart model."
"Love the 14 cup coffee option, timer worked great.Bought one 5 months in it was on all the time . Would not perk. Tried another.  Quit heating 2 months in.Ok, going for a third,the out.Other than quitting all the time it's great.Cross your fingers"
"I was disappointed , Mr. Coffee was always my favorite ."
There is NOT a replacement carafe for this 14 cup model!Mine is only a couple months old and I accidentally broke the carafe while hand washing it.I checked all the retailers on the Mr. Coffee website that handles replacement parts to no avail.I contacted Mr. Coffee and was told there were no replacement carafes available. So I'm stuck with a 2 month old machine that I can't use.
"POS company!!  The carafe is very thin glass.  Good chance you will break it, and guess what?Go to their site, search all the web, and... ""SORRY, THERE IS NO REPLACEMENT AT THIS TIME"" !!!!Just spent nearly $80, less than a month ago, now it's worthless to us.Buy some other brand, or you will risk throwing that money away.mr coffee's thinking:  none of our customers ever break their carafes, so we didn't think a replacement was necessary. So you wasted $80... too bad for you.  Genius management and customer support.  Yeah, I'm pissed. negative stars."
"I didn’t expect such poor customer service from a household company like Mr. Coffee. We purchased from a Walmart and did not keep the receipt, didn’t think there would be a reason to. The first pot brewed great, but after that it will not work. It stops brewing every 2-4 cups. beeping like the pot is full. When we reached out to Mr. Coffee they basically said since we don’t have a receipt they can’t help us. We had it for less than a week.  Went with a ninja instead and having better luck so far."
"I would give this coffee maker five stars, BUT... Even though I love everything about the operation of the unit, I have searched far and wide for a replacement carafe, and there is none available. So if I break it, I might as well throw it away. I have looked at the carafes from other brands and can fine none that will fit. A cynic would say, ""They  want me to buy a complete new unit if I break the carafe."" If that is true, shame on Mr. Coffee. If not true, why can't I find one? I do not recommend buying this coffee maker."
Will not turn off when time is up!  Plug in and start adding water and it is spitting and hissing right away!  Coffee gets way to hot to drink.
"Mr. Coffee® 14-Cup Programmable Coffee MakerThis is another well built Mr Coffee that is replacing my OLD Mr Coffee 12 cup.  I'm happy they included a new filter cup but as with my old machine I still have to wrap my grinds in the paper filter, turn it upside down and then the grounds stay up in the filter. If I don't do this, just like my old pot the grounds end up in the pot from the filter overflowing.  they really need to fix the pace of the water so it has a chance to brew through without brewing over the filter.  Anyway, my paper filter trick works and I've been doing it for years so I'll just continue.  This one has all the features I can use, strong brew, programmed for later or do it now.  It is a large machine to accommodate the larger pot.Two concerns I'll have to keep an eye on are the heating pad the pot sits on is already flaking apart. It had a spot chipped when I opened it and other area looks like it may flake off soon. See pics.  The other major issue is how hot my counter got after my test run.  I moved the machine back and the counter was almost too hot to touch.  If that continues this will be returned as it should not be heating the counter and there's a flaw in the heat distribution.  I'll test it again along with my old pot just to make sure of the problem. These issues are the reason for 2 stars.  After more tests I'll adjust my rating up or down depending on the results."
"Had for two months and one day I shut it off and when I got home for work the hot plate was still hot. There was a quarter inch of sludge in the bottom. When I walked in the door it was apparently something burning, I raised the lid and steam poured out and all the lights were off… FIRE HAZZARD"
"It worked fine for a while, but now it just overflows coffee grounds every time. Not buying Mr Coffee next time."
"We got this model to replace our previous 8-cup, easy to use, Mr. Coffee to accommodate a larger family group.  I have made and used MANY coffee pots over the years and this one has some serious flaws.  The filter basket included is too small to hold grounds for 14 cups without overflowing into the carafe and making a mess inside the brewing cavity.  We tried paper filters....again not large enough to hold grounds for 14 cups.  The family took this on as a project.  How hard is it to make a pot of coffee in a Mr. Coffee?  With this model, impossible.  The controls are clear but if you don't want a mess to clean up and weak coffee, stay away from this model."
Pot had a crack within two weeks of usage.  Coffee was everywhere in kitchen.
"I just received my keurig this morning.  Having gone through several models in the past, and admittedly my last model had all the bells and whistles (it broke when I cleaned it, my fault). I decided to purchase this - a simpler and more cost effective version. For the longevity of the machines, I hate to fork over a couple hundred dollars every time … Based on my first couple of uses - I like the compact size, the ability to choose my cup size and add more water in the reservoir than one cup; a step up from their most “basic” model. Although I was surprised by how noisy it is, and I realize I might need to reconsider using this when my family is still asleep. I am also concerned about its durability due to the quality of material used. It also takes a bit longer to brew a cup of coffee; rather than an instantaneous response with a push of a button, I found myself waiting for a minute to be sure it would brew (this was after the water had been heated). I should mention that I purchased this on sale and for the sale price I think it will work nicely as an interim keurig. If I had paid more money I would definitely return it."
"I purchased this coffee maker in November of 2023 because it got great reviews, came in a wonderful gray color and I felt that Keurig would manufacture a reliable, long-lasting product. The Keurig model at my workplace has served me and dozens of fellow workers for years.  However, my Keurig has already started to leak and dispense the wrong amount of water for various cup sizes.  I'm so disappointed! I expected a genuine Keurig product to last more than a year, but now feel I need to replace it with a different brand."
"I replaced my 10 yr old Keurig because it started making a noise and I thought it was going out. This new one makes a louder noise so if that will bother you, beware. There’s no filter. It brews faster than my old one.  It’s easy to use. Gets the job done. Coffee tastes great. I also noticed my countertop vibrates while using. Seems durable enough. Hasn’t shut off yet so unsure about the “auto shut off”."
I gave this one 3 stars for 2 reasons:  the coffee is not instantly brewed takes a couple minutes to warm up and the reservoir holds enough for only 3 cups of 10 oz coffee.  I feel like I am constantly refilling it.The product is kind of cheaper plastic - I did buy this on sale for $49 but it’s Not as sturdy as my last one.Bottom line - it brews coffee and it works!
The Keurig works as it should but the water tank is small. The description does say how much it holds but to put it into perspective it makes around 3 normal coffee cups. The frustrating part is the extremely short power cord. If this is going into an office environment that has rules about using coffee pots off an extension cord or power stripping and can’t put it right next to an outlet I’d try and find one with a longer cord.
"This is just okay,  I finally got it up to our condo and it makes a lot of noise.  Coffee tastes just okay - same as the coffee I use at home.  Not sure I would recommend this Keurig.  I like the one I have at home better."
I only use the Keuric to make my morning coffee and it doesn't make hot coffee it's  only warm coffee and it's cold before you can drink it all.This is my second coffee maker and I won't be buying another one. Going back to Mr. Coffee.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Right out of the box, it already sounds like it's ready to die, however it did deliver a hot cup of coffee. In this case, I made a double which, is about how much water the reservoir holds. Not sure if this is normal or if I just got a stinker. 🤷"
"The size is good and I like the extra reservoir for water, but its to loud when using. I got this to replace a different one I had. Overall, it gets the job done, I just don’t like how loud it is when you turn it on and brew a cup of coffee."
"If you have patience for your morning coffee, then this is the perfect coffee machine for you.  Have to turn on each time for using it, then wait for the water to heat up.  Not good for a fast drink, if you are rushing or in a hurry."
"After months of use, it started leaking hot water from the pod area. Became more so after time. Then, one year to the day, it stopped working."
"I bought this unit to replace the SAME unit I bought 7 years ago. Longevity, at least with the first one, was excellent as I use it quite often. The cord though is extremely short. I have the coffee maker in my office on a table and the cord is on the wall a bit lower. Don't care to hear about ""unsafe"" BS as again it has been there for 7+ years. New coffee maker cord, I did mention same model right, does not even halfway reach the plug. I have an extension cord on it now, which is highly UNSAFE. I will get a power strip I guess but I'm highly disappointed in the length of this cord."
"Typical machine, but this has an annoying trait... Does not keep water warm so it has to heat up every time. Making it 9 mins, 23 seconds at best to get a cup? That sucks KEURIG!"
To loud other than that works as it should
Makes a great cup of coffee.
"We moved from a higher end Keurig machine that quit on us to this less expensive one. Although I bought this in November, we had it on hand in case the earlier unit failed. And it did fail around February, so we put this one into service. At first it was fine and took a little bit to get used to since it did not offer the larger cup size that the better machine did but ok. After about 2 months, the selection of what size cup you wanted almost didn't matter. It would either overfill the cup or fill it only half way. That lasted for a while and now it has evolved into filling the cup size you selected properly BUT you have to power it off as soon as it is done otherwise it keeps going and spills over into the drain tray (thank goodness for that). So you basically have to babysit the machine if you want your cup to stop filling at the correct level. Not sure if this qualifies for a warranty claim but I'll be looking into it.THERE IS ONE PIECE OF GOOD NEWS to share: this machine requires you to lift the k-cup piercing section and close it before it will allow you to select the cup size you want. For someone who also drinks tea, I can't tell you how many times I forgot to remove the used pod and ran the machine for hot water only to see that coffee had mixed in with my tea forcing my to dump the cup and start over with old machine we had. So this is a nice improvement."
"This works just fine, no issues with the mechanics of it but the coffee that comes out of it just isn't very good. I have tried a few different coffee's thinking that it was just that but I don't think that's the problem. I'm not sure what the problem is but the coffee just doesn't taste very good . I have used other units and did not experience this so I think that it's the unit. Perhaps the water isn't hot enough...dunno, maybe it's just me but rarely use because it doesn't make a good cup of coffee."
"It looks nice and is easy to use but it is LOUD. Ridiculously loud. So much louder than the one we are replacing. Also the coffee is much weaker.  We are replacing a Hamilton Beach duo thermal pot and single brew combo. It still works great, just takes up too much space and we never use the thermal pot any more. So we saw this on sale. I'm disappointed at how obnoxiously loud it is and that my ten oz brew tastes like watered down coffee. Using the exact same pods as we used in the previous one, so I know what they should taste like. Hands down, this coffee pot is inferior. The only thing that saves the three star rating is that the water tank is removeable so I can clean it easily. That is this pot's only saving grace. I thought Keurig was supposed to be really good, so I had no trepidation in making this purchase. I would not buy it again, nor would i recommend it to anyone that likes a strong, or normal, cup of coffee. If you like super weak brew or tiny cups so you need to use two or three pods to get a  normal cup, then this is the pot for you."
"Crazy loud.  Ridiculously overpriced. I hate that there is no option to turn off auto power on/off.  It just automatically shuts off after some time, causing you to wait for a cup of coffee.  I wanted to replace my broken one with the exact same model, but it was twice as expensive as this one.  I use reusable K-cup filter things and they work fine.  I do find that I need to fill the cups right up. I would wait for a sale to buy this.  I was able to get it on a Black Friday sale, otherwise, it's really not worth it to me."
"I bought this to use in a small apartment and I haven't officially utilized it yet. I pulled it out of the box today to inspect it before the 30 day return window closes  Although the color black that I purchased was a little less expensive than the color options, I  am surprised that the quality of merchandise doesn't seem to reflect the cost of this machine. I'm also not sure if I inadvertently purchased a pre-owned machine because the box was previously taped shut when i received it. Honestly, i am not that impressed."
"I had high hopes for this Keurig single serve brewing system. I purchased a new one for my daughter and she was thrilled.However I got a previously owned one for myself. It's been sitting in a closet since February, so I can't send it back.I should have been alerted to an issue when I observed the water tank lid was taped to the water tank/holder.The auto shut-off works for about 30 seconds after which water continues to flow into the cup or drain rake.Obviously this makes for a watered down cup.The water drains until I turn the unit off.I have a feeling the unit was dropped while in the box.I'm a Nespresso user but wanted to try something different. I think I'll stick to what works for me, but it's not this thing.On a side note, I love the appearance. Hence the 2 stars."
"Overall good product. The only annoying thing is always asking to fill more water. Come on I know lots of water there why still asking more. I put more and more, but I need just small amount of water."
"... is suppose to be waking up drinking coffee, not fighting with your coffee maker trying to get it to work right. It's loud, slow and sometimes unresponsive. Water tank is small, after making one large serving I was prompted to add more water. Bought this to replace my older cheaper unit but my old one worked better and faster then this one and it was 30 bucks cheaper. 3 stars is for I liked the button layout easy to use no confusing button programing. Also the last cup of coffee I made nothing came out I push large cup size again and it gives me small cups serving. I can see why this is on sale."
I tried various methods to get this machine to work.  Sometimes it would heat but normally it brewed but the coffee was less then Luke warm.
the only thing that bothers me about this coffee maker is that its toooo noisy!!!! for use when you do'nt want to wake anybody!!!
"Bought November 2023, worked well but didn't last a year. September 2024 it will not turn on. Very disappointed."
Decided to buy a new coffee maker since it’s been a few years. Disappointed because it is not the Keurig I remember. Since the price was so good I will try it. Slow to heat and is very noisy. I originally had Keurig products and switched to another brand which was really nice. Bottom line is I just want a cup of hot coffee.
Used only once and it was OK but not great. After reading all the maintenance information I decided to return. Making coffee should not be that complicated. Bought it because I thought it would simplify things for my wife - it really didn't and would have added more maintenance chores for me. I'm getting older and like to keep things simple instead of adding more work and specialized cleaning processes to my daily life.
I purchased this Keurig during Black Friday sale to replace the Keurig I had purchased in October 2023 that suddenly stopped turning on the first of November.This one only makes an 8 oz cup when the large button is pushed - which is designated to be 10 oz. So in addition to not making a full cup it feels like I’m wasting coffee since it’s not making a full cup. Boo.
"If, like me, you plan to install a float that allows it to refill automatically, you won’t notice the deficiency. If you are a couple that drink even a few coffees a day, believe me you will. The rear reservoir is not too handy and the tiny cover, finger grip is impractical. Function is fine."
"I liked the earlier, smaller version. This machine clogs easily and leaves coffee grounds in my cup. It will brew an inch of liquid in the bottom of my cup when this happens and I have to open clean the top and lift the the cup to empty it then try agian and again. It is not a certain pod it is random and takes me 30 minutes to get a cup of coffee. Not convenient at all. This is the second one I got because the first one did this and quit working. I'm not buying one every few months! Not good coffee machine"
"When my larger Keurig died, decided to go with a smaller unit.  No review I read said anything about it being so noisy when actually brewing.  The noise from the water heating, which is understandable, is quiet compared to when it starts brewing."
The best thing I can say about it is that it brews hot even if a large size fills only half a cup. The brewing process is very loud and spits the coffee out. The water container is inconveniently on the back of the machine. This is the third Keurig I have owned and will seriously reconsider ever purchasing another.
Water reservoir too small
"I have had 4 Kurigs. They have really changed the quality if their machines. When it brews, it's always a different amount that actually brews per cup. Also,  it continues to drip long after the cup has finished brewing."
"Purchased on June 30, 2024 and use it for 1-2 cups per day. I’m an earlier riser (4am) and enjoy my coffee while waking up and starting the day. Today, August 22, 2024, I woke up and the coffee maker does not turn on. I’ve unplugged it, tried four (4x) other outlets and cleaned the water reservoir for it to not turn on. The product is less than two months old and is dead! Now I have to wait over five hours for Keurig’s customer service line to open to have them refund or replace the make nevertheless have to spend money I should not and go to Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks for my morning joe. Thanks Keurig - you owe me every mornings coffee I have to now go out and buy until you replace or refund me with a new machine"
The unit requires you to fill the water reservoir when it is still half full.  Just annoying to have to fill it more often then my last machine.
"I have a generic 1 cup coffee maker that works perfectly.  The reason I wanted this machine was the name and the great price the black model was priced at during a deal. I thought, what a bargain,  a Keurig machine at such a bargain.  When I opened the box it was almost an immediate disappointment to feel the materials. All the pieces felt like the type of plastic that cracks easily. Especially the handle that is vital to the operation of the machine. Also, the lid to the water reservoir does not fit snugly.  I would have been concerned about dust or aerosol cleaners getting in if I didn't double check the placement. (My generic one has a lid that fits into the interior lip snugly, but not tight. Adding water is easy, not difficult to get into,  just remove and replace the lid ) The water filler on the Keurig is difficult to get the water in or remove, fill,  and put back in position. And again, the reservoir is made of the easy crack material.  It is not a heavy duty plastic, something that I expect with something that holds the weight of water. The lid doesn't have a heavy feel when closing with the latch.  I was again disappointed with the thickness of the material compared to the generic one I am STILL using after 6 years. I went from a Bunn to the generic because I am a single person home now and I didn't need the 10 cup Bunn. A single serve seemed like the answer and I purchased a generic to see if I was happy with the operation.I have tried to find something nice to say about the Keurig. I can't.  It takes over a minute to heat up.  Longer than the one I have. The generic has no scratches,  no cracks, it's in great condition.  I scratched the black finish during set up on the side of the Keurig. Not obvious,  but it was NEW, who wants a scratch in less than 30 minutes of owning!.So, instead of going through the aggravation of returning,  I packed it up like new. Taped it up, and dropped it at the food kitchen.  I figured they would know if someone had a coffee pot blow up.Hate to say this, but I can't recommend this product."
"In the past, I've always bought the top of the line Keurig but came to realize that I never use any function other than my one button I use for every cup.  It seemed like a waist of money to pay for features I never used so I went with this basic model.  It does the job.  I don't want to say it's cheap but you do get what you pay for.  It can look a little cheap and the water reservoir is smaller than my previous models.  I honestly can't say if I'd buy it again or not.  It's fine."
"This coffee maker is so difficult and frustrating to work with!  The cord is short and stiff.  The water reservoir is only good for 2 cups and is in the back, making it difficult to access.  Additionally, the cover to the water reservoir has a tiny tab that is hard to pinch to remove and replace the cover.  I put a small binder clip on it to make it easier & that works until the clip falls off.  I tried putting the thing on a lazy Susan, but that short, stiff cord makes it impossible to rotate completely to access the reservoir.  On the upside, it makes a cup of coffee super fast!"
"The reservoir on this Keurig constantly needs filled.  Only makes 3 large cups before needing more.  It's the loudest Keurig I've owned, but more annoying is that it shuts off, and then takes several minutes to heat up before you can brew your cup.  Even more annoying is that it doesn't ""remember"" that you lifted the lid, so you have to open and close it 2-3x before it will allow you to select a cup size and begin brewing"
"I have had two of these - the first lasted 18 months and the second lasted 5 months.  When the first coffee maker failed, I replaced it with the same maker because I liked the size, the appearance, and it was easy to use.  But I am now finished with Keurig.  My coffee maker was not overused as I make only one cup per day and I am the only person who uses it."
"I have had keruigs from commercial to single serves. This is my 3rd single serve and well color me unimpressed. It has got to be the loudest coffee maker I have ever had. Maybe I just got the dud of the batch but I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it, I would return it but Amazon makes it a pita to do a return so I will keep it and wear ear plugs in the morning."
This thing is cheap. Makes half a cup of coffee!  It was cheap- so you get what you pay for!
"I bought this exact coffee maker in May, 2024, and it's already stopped working correctly.  I use filtered water and the right k cups but it takes at least 10 minutes to make a partial cup.  I've cleaned it with vinegar as well."
.It worked for 9 month's of light use and quit half way thru my first morning cup this morning.
I am disappointed in this Keurig. I picked it because of the slim design but didn’t realize how hard it is to get to the water tank or that it would need to be filled so often. I recently moved to a new state and would have returned the item if I hadn’t had family here in need of coffee while unpacking!
I trying to decide if I keep this coffee maker. The problem is a very inconsistent amount of coffee per cup. One cup will be full and the next cup might only we 1/2. Not sure why but not real happy so far.
Its bigger than I thought a makes loud noise when making coffee.
Not nearly as easy as a regular one cup Keurig machine
"We have used Keurig machines for many, many years. Our first machine lasted forever. By the time we purchased the second machine,  Keurig must have incorporated planned obsolescence into it's business model because it lasted only about 2 years. So, we purchased a more ""updated"" and streamlined Keurig. As other reviews mention, (but we did not heed the warning),  the amount dispensed by each button varies every time.  What a surprise every morning! Also, the largest pour doesn't even begin to fill a normal (not jumbo) coffee cup. Ever. Additionally,the water reservoir is way too small,  requiring filling much more often than the last one we owned. An annoyance, but coupled with the other issues, just compounds the reasons I regret buying this Keurig.Unfortunately for us, I am not really a coffee drinker, and hubby just suffered in silence long enough that I've missed the return window.Sorry, would not recommend."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Ive been saving up, specifically for a new Keurig (dropped my K-Duo while packing) and just purchased this 2 months ago (Nov or Dec 2023).  Just a few into this new Keurig, it made an unfamiliar noise and hesitated at the start of the brew.  It drip drip dribbled 1/4 cup and continued on to a full brew.  I thought,  hmmm...must be ""breaking in"" period of the new machine.  Had issues a couple brews later as well and thought it to be odd.  Then, as my grandson finished brewing me a cup, he alerted me that it was making a weird noise at the end of cycle.  It's brewed with hesitation the last few brews.Unfortunately, I've been in and out of the hospital quite often in the past 6-9 wks with4 -10+ day's stays at each admission.  That being said, this machine has gone unused in this time and sadly, the 30 day return window has passed.  I ordered  my coffee pods ahead of time and had my son stop by the market to get my Sweet Cream Coffee Creamer (it's like dessert in a cup!).  If you're a coffee lover, there's nothing like a good cup of coffee!!  I get home, greet my furkids and brewed a nice cup of coffee.  Let me tell you, it was mighty GOOD!!  Get up today, greet my furkids and go to brew a cup of coffee and sadly, nothing but noise and a few drips.  After numerous brew attempts, unplugging it, reseating the water tank, the brews were all unsuccessful.  I try 3 hrs later and finally brewed a cup.  Now, it's a worthless 2 month old useless Keurig.  This is my 3rd Keurig since they've come out and I am so disappointed with this model.I purchased a second one on or around 12/10/23 as a gift for my sister.We didn't see each other until 2 weeks ago and sadly, she is experiencing the same problem and this is just her 2nd week of using hers.  Keurig, I believe that you may have a design flaw here.  I hope you make this right with myself and other buyers whom may be experiencing the same issues."
"This is my 4-5th Keurig. When I needed to buy a new one, I saw this color and loved it immediately. It was on sale for half price so I jumped at it.The color is great. It’s beautiful.The water reservoir is a weird shape that can’t hold much and is hard to remove so I just use a cup to refill it. There’s so much space on the back, I don’t know why they didn’t do a large reservoir like other models have, but it’s not a deal breaker.The one thing that almost made me send it back is that it is the loudest Keurig I have ever owned. Like obnoxiously loud. Good luck to anyone trying to sleep in the next room. If I didn’t love the color so much, I would have returned it."
"I have an old Keurig that got clogged up because I was using hard water through its piping. I got this tide me over until I fixed it and in case I couldn’t. What I love about a Keurig is coffee is accessible quickly and all day long! LolThis works great but the issue I have with it is that you have to wait before every cup for the water to warm up where my old Keurig keeps warm water on hand all day long. I thought it would be a lot smaller than my old Keurig as well and it’s really only about 2 inches smaller so not a big space saver if you’re debating on that.Also, if this helps, I found a video on YouTube that fixed the issue I was having so if you’re thinking of replacing a Keurig because it’s clogged check YouTube first."
"I use the product to make coffee.  I purchased it to replace my older, but better Keurig coffee maker.  This model is not as well made, seems like cheaper plastic, water reservoir is relatively small and it takes more steps and longer to make the coffee."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought this for our upstairs hallway coffee station to replace our old Keurig. It’s so noisy I can’t make coffee without waking up my family!  It doesn’t sound like any Keurig I’ve ever used.
"When my Keurig Cafe stopped working, I started using my faithful standby a Melitta drip cup which worked fine, but I missed the auto brew for pre-work mornings.  The color caught my eye and combined with a sale, I hit send!  It is a beautiful color indeed, but boy is the brew cycle loud.  If you like a peaceful start to your morning, and enjoy making that first cup of coffee, this brewer is a rude wake-up!  It really sounds like a cheap brand and I am really disappointed with how it sounds.  I do hope that the sound is not indicative of how long it will last.  I also have an older model at the office and it’s lasted over 5 years.  Neither of my earlier models sounded like this. It really took me by surprise!"
"I feel like most households, at this point in time, have or have had a Keurig. I bought this one since it was smaller than the one we had & wanted more counter space. While it's like other Keurig in how it works, the water tank etc, I did notice a lower quality of the product. The plastic seems thinner (cheaper), it isn't quiet & actually rather loud! It takes a while to warm up & it doesn't always run through the coffee setting, when you select a cup size. It warms up and then does nothing. It most likely will be returned as the quality as a whole, just isn't there."
"Not only are there better coffee makers that have more features and produce better results for around the same $80 price range but they also last longer than 5 months. Because this one lasted me 5 months before the pump failed.It's also only capable of k-cups, nothing else. I got a new one after this (a Ninja) that has a modular build allowing for k-cups as well as full sized cups of coffee grounds up to 24oz. It also has a range of settings for the number of ounces you want, from 4oz to 24oz and plenty of settings in between. It has a much larger water reservoir while have only a slightly larger but narrow profile compared to this hunk of plastic junk.Maybe I wouldn't be so harsh if this were more appropriately priced but it's way over priced for what you get. Competitors offer far better products and this is one of the few purchases I have had such regret over in the past few years. I usually do a much better job researching products and making smart choices but this was easily one of the worst over the past few years.Never again."
"Our coffee maker just stopped so I bought this one on prime so we would get it the next day.  Not real happy with it.  We have had 3 Keurig makers but this one takes a long time to heat up, only holds enough water for a couple of cups.  So when this one quits working I will never buy such a cheap one again.  Keurig is a good coffee maker but this one isn't one I would recommend buying.  It is low in cost but not so good in performance.  The old saying, you get what you pay for is true!!"
I don't like the water holder on the back. But it does make the coffee fast and hot.
Used it once and returned it the next day. Seems to be a few generations ago. Got the 59.99 one and love it.
"This machine makes a hot cup of coffee, yes, but not true to sizes listed. Unless you push the button for the largest size, you won't get much of a cup. Also, quite a large machine, and takes up a lot of space on the counter, and doesn't fit under cabinets.Would've returned,  but husband threw out the box. So, dealing with it 🙄"
Coffee maker does not fill cup to desired size that was pick on side.Old keurig worked better until it broke down.
Cords realky sortCoffee is vert weak water cones through pod ti fast
This machine is noisy. It has horizontal up top controls which I don't like.
This coffee maker it’s the perfect size for my needs.  I would of rate it a 5 star but The only disappointment that I do have with this Keurig it’s a bit slow on brewing and also towards the end of brewing it splashes a lot of little coffee droplets on the counter top for some reason.
Not sure: devices seems to have problems after 2 weeks of ownership
Came without instructions and broken plastic pieces in box
The machine only lasted a few months and died. Do not waste your money buying this one!Would never recommend this machine.
I loved it for the first few days then it started to burn my coffee. My coffee tasted burnt. Then the amount of build up that gets in these is crazy….. I barely used it then ran it through a cleaning cycle and my cup was brown.
"I bought this because of the price. I had a k-slim and one of the bigger $120+ ones with the tank on the side. This one doesn't brew it as strong as my other machines have, even when I brew the smallest oz cup. For the price I can't complain though."
"We bought our Keurig Compact in Dec 2023. We love it but lately when we brew a mug on the 8oz. setting the Keurig continues the brew cycle, overfilling the mug & spilling coffee onto the counter. Why is it doing this?"
"I love how small this is for our camper. However, it’s always saying add more water even when it’s half full of water! Very annoying when you just want a small cup or want to top off a cup and there’s enough in there already!"
No directions included.
This is our third attempt at this exact model and I am over it now.It is noisy and spluttery and I do believe I will step up to something much nicer next time and avoid this product
"This arrives quickly and well packaged.  It makes a good cup of coffee and I like the smaller size, BUT it is very loud and noisy!  I am debating whether the noise is a deal breaker for me.  I had a slim model that only lasted two months, and after that a different brand that lasted three months.  I may return this, but reading the other reviews of all makes and models, most mention that they only worked for a few weeks or months.  I had my old original  Keurig for almost ten years and it was still working.  What has happened to the quality??  It feels like you take a chance no matter which one you buy.UPDATE I decided to return this because of how noisy it is during the process of making a cup of coffee."
The machine is very LARGE for what it does. That being said everything it does is SMALL. The three coffee size buttons could be called small smaller and smallest. The reservoir is small too. Not very useful when it holds enough for two coffees and shuts off with the ‘add water’ light when there is just probably enough for a third left.I would recommend going with a different brand that has larger water storage and a smaller footprint. And save the money on the brand name. It is not worth it.
The system is extremely noisy. The pod lid is quite flimsy. It requires a refill of water after only two cups.
"Lowest number of ounces to choose is 8.Coffee too weak even with a dark roast, bold coffee"
"We bought this as a spare single cup brewer.  The other Keurig K-Compact Single cup is less than two thirds the width of this one.  Due to its size, we re-boxed it and returned it to Amazon unused.  I'm looking at other store to see if Keurig still makes that unit, as it takes up very little counter space, has a decent size reservoir and brews well."
"I like the slim size.  I'm having trouble getting a good cup of coffee.  I've tried several different options from brands of coffee, k cups, reusable cups , stronger flavor, etc. I think it is the faster brewing process. The water runs clear after about 15 seconds leaving a very weak brew."
The first one I bought stopped working after months of purchase i ordered another and found it cheaper at Walmart so i sent it back and have yet to get my refund also the lid had a little crack in it!
"I have had a Keurig of some kind for over 10 years. My 3 year larger one was starting to overheat.  I saw this on sale. Huge buyers remorse.This takes longer, is noisy, and the coffee is weak. I see a larger size with brew strength on sale, thinking if it. This one is a bit compact but the plastic has a cheaper feel, clearly not made as well made as any Keurig I have owned. May keep as backup..."
"It works fairly well,  about the same size as the normal/ regular size kuerigs.  The so called compact size was one of the reasons I choose this model. The watts are a little lower, and that was the main reason I chose it.  I am off grid, so I have to consider all wattage use."
Water reservoir is on the back and difficult to fill
"Make a high pitched whistle as it brews, annoying."
"My first Keurig lasted for several years, so I was happy to buy the same brand again. This unit started to leak after the first month of use and is now trash. I'll be trying something else. Very disappointed"
This was a gift for my wife. It's a little bit louder than our previous model but does make a cup faster than the last model. I would advise anyone who is sensitive to noise look elsewhere. The reservoir allows for about 2.5 cups per fill.
"I have used this product for years, I ordered this one when I redid my kitchen to match. Was very disappointed it only lasted a year a quit working. I bought the original k-cup classic to replace it and am much happier."
"I woke up yesterday morning looking forward to my cup of coffee—and nothing! The coffee machine made all the right noises, but not one drop of coffee came out of the spout. I tried everything possible to make it work again, but no coffee. I was disappointed and angry because I bought this Keurig on June 24, 2024. This was my third time purchasing a Keurig coffee maker, and I had no problem with it until yesterday. I wanted to contact the seller, but my return date had expired. I am never rebuying a Keurig; I feel the hype around this manufacturer is overrated."
low water capacity
Only had it for 4 months RIP. I bought a $30 maker before that it lasted a lot longer than the name brand maker. Worked great up till the other morning $100 down the drain.
I haven’t had it long but it’s working fine so far. I DON’T like that I have to fill it so often but because it’s not too big it’s easier to clean more often.
We only had this for 6 months before it died on us.
This Keurig was defective after 30 days of using. Not Keurig standards that I am used to.  Had to purchase another one.
"The description states it is compact.  It is not.  The water dispenser is half the size, the machine itself is big."
Product worked for about 1 month and the started leaking.
"While I realize this is a preference, this unit simply doesn't output coffee at a hot enough temperature. Furthermore, there's no ability to adjust this, unlike many coffee makers in this price range.This really is my only complaint with the unit. The grinder works great, and it makes a very good pot of drip coffee, which is even better after I stick it in the microwave for about 30-45 seconds. The fact is though, it's a coffee maker. Its output should be significantly hotter than it is. I would not buy this unit again for this reason."
"The the pot heater should be on a automatic shut off  and on. I'm afraid of it going burn up. I've had  lots of Buns coffee pots. They were much better than this one. From what it cost, It's sucks!!"
It is working good now.
"I wanted to good quality coffee maker. While this does brew coffee well, the set up takes way too long. 15 minutes just to warm the water not including brew time is just not practical. We missed the return window so we have to deal with brewing coffee the night before."
"Update: I've had the maker for a week. Today, I went to switch on the hot plate and got shocked pretty darn good; the hot plate light no longer turned on, after, but it still heats. I'm unsure if I should return it. I worry that whatever short happened to the light inside the switch may also eventually impact the coffee maker itself, and possibly after the return window closes, but it's also a major hassle to return, and if it's just simply that the light burnt out, I can handle that. But it's not a great look for a $150 coffee pot to have these type of malfunctions a week after use, and have updated my stars accordingly.After the fill process, the maker was ready to make a great cup of coffee; just be sure to flip on the power button after plugging it in. :)It brews super fast, and the cup of coffee it brews has such a great, rich flavor. The front water pour is extremely convenient, making it much easier to fill the water in the tank; and thankfully no more pulling out the maker each time coffee needs to be made. I genuinely love that I can keep the warming plate on for as long as I choose, because nothing is more frustrating than going to get a cup of coffee and suddenly realizing the pot shut off, and your coffee is now cold.It looks stylish and sleek. I appreciate the corresponding chrome on the handles of the pot and coffee basket."
"Set up and build---While a lot of people don’t pay attention to product manuals, I’m not one of them. I even read the terms and conditions before accepting them, which I know 9 out of 10 people reading this review don’t. In spite of that, I had a hard time setting up the coffee machine after receiving it today.First of all, using the lid as a trigger is stupid. Moving the machine for any reason with the lid open may damage or crack the lid easily. Secondly, it’s natural human tendency to close the lid but doing so caused the water to flow and made a mess because the carafe wasn’t in place.Then, the power switches. The manual says ‘I’ is on and ‘O’ is off. There’s a blue light that comes on when it’s on, but the light is in the shape of …you guessed it…an O. So, I filled up water, flicked the switch to what I later realized was the off position, and waited half an hour. Coffee came out like ice tea.The carafe lid is also super flimsy, so much so that cleaning it runs the risk of cracking it. I’ve had a Bunn MCU for years and the insertable pods are built like bricks. clearly, Bunn is cutting cost in the wrong places.Ease of use---Once set up and left on (*), the machine is fairly easy to use. You pour water in that displaces roughly equal volume of already heated water (hello Archimedes), and coffee starts coming out.(*) If the machine is not on already, it has to be warmed up for 15 minutes (according to the manual). During this time, it'd have been nice if light on the power button changed from red (not ready) to blue/green (ready), but alas, no one at Bunn thought of this simple idea.During these 15 minutes, the machine makes a humming/buzzing sound that comes from the water in the tank being heated up. Some reviews have complained about the sound being too loud and heard from other rooms in the house. Not for me; unless you're a K9 trainer, I don't think this is an issue.It can take up to 4 minutes (according to the manual) for coffee to stop flowing. Seems like a long time, but then, if you're making a full pot, may be. I have only made up to 6 cups so far (max is 10).Taste---This machine makes coffee that ain't bitter. After having gulped down bitter coffee for years and thinking I'm used to ""strong"" coffee, I'm still coming to terms with the taste of coffee made by this machine, and I don't dislike it. I won't be surprised if I acquire the taste.On the flip side, making strong coffee is almost impossible. I’ve experimented with twice the amount of coffee beans, and the outpouring taste didn’t much."
"We have owned many of these Bunn fast brewers over the years, and over all we love them. Having said that, this one, and the one before it, leak all over the counter… apparently you have to pour in the water VERY SLOWLY, and it will eliminate/mitigate the leaking. Bunn, let me ask you a question? If I’m willing to pay the premium for these fast brewers, what makes you think I want to stand there and slowly trickle the water in? It should be fast, just like the brewing process is… you know, like it used to be?The older units were not this way… Bunn even sold a plastic water pitcher, that you can still buy, to easily fill up the machine quickly. None of our older machines leaked at all, especially like these newer ones. So somewhere, some how, Bunn changed something and “improved” it… or most likely made it cheaper."
"Makes coffee fast! But after pouring the water in for the next brew, it’s very loud!! Heating the cold water."
"Second review : about a year in and the unit is leaking on my counter. I finally had nough and called the compamy. Since it was under warianty they promptly replaced the unit. But - they wanted me to send the previous unit back in the box the replacement unit would come in - at my expense.  At first I agreed but found out it would cost $17 to ship so I called back after the replacement arrived to say I waśn't going to ship the defective one back. The guy in customer service told me it's in the warranty in the  booklet the unit came in that I agree to send it back. I told him I was not aware when I bought the unit that they expected me to honor something I could not read before I made the purchase as it was inside the box!  Anyway, the guy said he would ""mark it on my file"" that I refused to send back the leaky unit and would not be eligible to return the replacement. I responded that if the replacement also leaked I wouldn't get ańother Bunn to replace it - I would research to Find a better option.......which is where I am now...it leaks. No more Bunns for me.The only issue I had was in understanding the set up.  The first time you use it, fill it with 2 full carafes of water.  This water will all go into the reservoir.  After the 15 minutes it takes the water to heat up, you THEN put the Coffee grounds into the filter and then add a THIRD carafe of water and close the lid. Your Coffee will be ready in 4 minutes (for a full carafe).  The reservoir Supplies the hot water to brew the Coffee immediately.  The third carafe replaces the hot water taken from the reservoir for your current brew.  This will heat up and be ready for the next carafe.  The Coffee maker is meant to Stay on 24/7.  Otherwise you must turn it on and wait 15 minutes for the reservoir to heat up.  Once it heat up add the grounds, add thewater and in 4 minutes it is ready.  Makes good Coffee!  I don't like it strong so with the circular shower head soaking all the grounds I Find using only 4 scoops of grounds for a full pot is perfect."
"I use 74g of coffee for a full pot.  Even with the Bunn coffee filters, coffee consistently overflows the filter.  Even less than that a full pot will do it.  I called Bunn and they sent a restrictor nozzle to replace the existing one at no charge.  It solved the problem, but as you would guess, the nozzle slows the flow so it takes longer to make a pot.  That kind of negated the main reason I selected the Bunn.  I appreciate they solved the problem.  But, now I have to wait much longer for my coffee.  I haven't timed a full pot yet, but it's gone from about 4.5-5 min to 6-7 min.  A 4 min pot is not much longer time to wait with the Keurig.  But, now it's no faster than anything else on the market."
"I grew up with Bunn coffee makers, so I knew what I was buying, or so I thought. I was aware that the heat plate does not turn off automatically, however the switch on the front that controls the heat plate is not sufficient. The model that I grew up with had a bright red switch and it was located near the top where it could be seen easily. This model has a small black switch located at the bottom and the light is blue and very dim. You barely can see it. Be prepared to forget that the heat plate is on. Not safe! But otherwise brews good coffee."
"I have used a Bunn for literally decades.  This new model has a much larger footprint than my old model (see pics), but doesn't do anything new.  I like the speed at which these make a pot of coffee and generally enjoy the flavor.  Like other reviewers mentioned;  Water continues to drip (although not as bad as older model), the blue light on the hotplate switch is difficult to see, so easy to miss and leave on.  I don't like how the newly designed funnel for the grounds attaches to the main unit.  It doesn't seem as secure, and left me with old ones I can't use.  Because the water in the heated tank evaporates, you never get a pot of coffee without adding additional water.  Pour 50 oz in, get 40 oz out.  Finally, with all of the coffee makers Bunn has produced you would think they could design a decent carafe.  The older ones varied, some spilling coffee all over the counter as you poured, some not bad.  The new carafe tends to spill coffee on the counter when pouring the first cup.  It has a much smaller hole in the top (more like their commercial carafes).  To get all of the coffee out you need to tip the carafe up to about 80 degrees.  In this position the hot steam rises up and burns your hand."
Unfortunately I returned this item. I liked that it was made in the USA. I had no need to keep it on all day so I turned it on before I went to bed as I didn't want to wait 15 minutes for the water to heat in the morning. The coffee was not hot after brewing. The hot plate is very hot without any additional settings. Within 20 minutes of coffee sitting on the hot plate it smelled and tasted burnt.
"Why would you ever read the instructions for a coffee brewer that has two switches and nothing else? You wouldn't. You would add some water, ground coffee beans, and flip the switches. Apparently that kills your machine. Yep I did this right out of the box and killed it. If you read the instructions you will see that there is a mandatory initial setup. It tells you that if you plug in this brewer before you jump through a series of hoops you will permanently damage the product.Well when I noticed that there wasn't anything pouring into the carafe I opened the instructions and performed their silly setup. They tell you to fill the carafe with water and pour it into the tank, then slide it under and wait four minutes until the water starts to fill it. It tells you to do it again, and again until you see the water. So I filled the carafe again and poured it into the tank. A few minutes later the water began to empty into it. The carafe filled almost all the way and stopped. At this point it tells you to plug in the machine and flip the power switch. Wait fifteen minutes for the tank to accumulate heat and now you're ready to brew. The next page tells you how to do the thing that we all already know how to do.So what now? My carafe is almost full of water. Do I pour it out? I guess....How about all that water still in the tank? Does it tell you what to do with it? nopeYou can't even see how much water is in it! Have you ever had a coffee machine that doesn't have a little window with line markers to see the amount of water in it, or at least have a lid to open so you can see it? Well this machine doesn't have either of those luxuries. You're just supposed to guess that you now have to pour out all the water, then assume to tip it on its head and into the sink so it can all empty out of the drip spout. What an incredibly, stupid design!Well I finished their little initialization but the machine was already dead. I hope Bunn enjoys the tens of thousands of coffee brewers they're getting sent back to them, because I guarantee that a machine as simple as this, no one is reading the owner's manual before plugging it in and just trying to use it.whatajoke"
I bought this to replace a Bunn that latest maybe a decade or more.  It was obvious right out of the box that this one was not as well built and with lower quality hardware.  Maybe I will luck out and it will last a while.  Just not holding my breath.
"While this works great, we haven’t had it a week and the light on the on/off switch is burned out!"
The bunn not so great my other one worked great for 12+ years haven’t had this bunn maybe 3 months and it’s aready taken forever to make a pot of coffee should of stuck with the other bunn and got one just like it i have had 2 of them and they both worked over 12 years
"The coffee is not hot enough is the first problem. If you use the warmer plate to heat the coffee it distorts the flavor FAST. The warmer plate should be used to heat other things such as tea, milk, etc....not the coffee. If you leave the coffee in the pot on the warmer plate for even a short length of time you will be greeted to the burnt coffee taste. I recommend people to NOT use the warmer plate on this model to keep the coffee hot. Invest in a thermal carafe to pour the coffee into when done, or select a different model Bunn. To sum it up: this model makes coffee at at temperature less than ideal."
"I wish I hadn't bought this. It always leaves coffee grounds in my coffee, which would be bad enough, but to make it terrible it doesn't have an auto-off so if you forget to turn it off (and I did) then you wake up eight hours later with a dry burnt carafe."
"While I love this machine for how fast and hot the coffee comes out, it was a little confusing to figure out at first. Once I figured that out, I realized that because of the speed that the coffee comes out, it makes weak coffee so I have to use twice the amount that I normally use. It goes so fast that there is no brewing process.  I have been back-and-forth on whether or not to return this item.  You also have to buy their coffee filters because they are taller than the ones you would buy at the grocery store. If you don’t buy them you will have a coffee grind mess on your hands. Still I’m not sure I’ll return it because it does make really hot and fast coffee."
"This is way too slow, imo. Takes 7-9 minutes to brew a pot of coffee. I would expect that from a Walmart coffee maker but not a Bunn. It also doesn’t brew a full pot of coffee. It usually stops jut below the 8 cup mark. Very frustrating."
Bunn coffee is by far the best tasting coffee but the speed brewing takes away from that. The coffee runs through it so fast that it gets so weak because it has no time to soak up the  grounds and get the strength you want. I end up opening and closing the lid about 4 times while the water is running through it so the water has time to sit in the grounds and actually brew. So you have to use more coffee grounds but get a weak pot of coffee. To get a strong pot I let it start to pour through then open the lid and let the water drip. When it is done dripping then I close it about 30 seconds then open the top again. I repeat this until the carafe is full. I plan on ordering a replacement part for the sprayhead to make the brewing slower. Hopefully this will fix the problem. It will take longer to brew but it will save on the extra coffee it takes to get that much needed caffeine in my morning cup.
This was an exact replacement for a Bunn that was several years old. Thankfully we still had the old one so we just used that brew basket. Little disappointed in that but overall love the product.
"Within a month, the bottom where the heat plate is cracked from front to back. Hadn't moved it since it was placed on counter new out of box. Every Bunn we have owned was great, lasted years. This one just seemed of poorer quality."
"Makes hot coffee and brews very quickly: Runs a little loud. However biggest problem is once you turn the burner on to keep the coffee warm, it does not automatically turn off- like an iron or curling iron does. I am afraid I am going to burn my house down! I have left it on  two or three times and have come home to an awful smell and a very hot carafe with burnt coffee. Back on the hunt for a new machine…."
"My family and extended family have been using Bunn coffee makers as long as i can remember...have never had an issue. Old Bunn seemed to be losing its ability to heat properly, coffee just wasn't hot enough, not a problem it had a long life and a lot of use. Paid $150 for new  Bunn, and have been nothing but disappointed. we all like coffee strong always add extra coffee to get desired flavor.This coffee pot will not brew strong coffee no matter how much coffee you put in filter it ends up sending coffee everywhere but no strong coffee, i guess its the speed in which the water is dumped is too fast. maybe you should consider including an adapter that allows less water flow so the coffee actually is able to soak thru and brew a good cup of coffee. Have used Bunn so long i don't even know where to look for a coffee pot with similar design, but this just brews hot coffee colored water. so disappointed do you not do quality testing?do you have flow restriction adapter to help brew stronger coffee?"
"I want to love this, but it has issues. There's no water fill line on the side, and the ones on the top are a bit difficult to see. Are you supposed to keep this powered on all the time, or just wait 15 minutes every morning before you can brew coffee ? This seems like a better machine for an office than for home use. I'm having trouble getting the brew strength right and I think it's because the fast brew doesn't allow enough time for the water to really soak the grinds. I might return this, sadly. I just want a straightforward, high quality coffeemaker !"
They are made so cheap now.  The part you pull out to put coffee filter in and fill with coffee is too tight.  The coffee pot is the same as other coffee pots .  I had a Bunn before and loved it but this time the quality is not there!  Not a happy birthday 🎁 🥲
"This seemed like a good coffee maker, we liked everything about it except it dripped excessively as shown in pics.Perhaps this was just a defective unit, Bunn is a good company."
"I really wanted to like this coffee maker. Counted on Bunn reputation and mostly favorable reviews. It replaced a simple, 10 year-old Mr. Coffee programmable model. The Bunn makes great coffee but you have to have patience. If you have to wait 15 minutes for the tank to heat, pour in the desired amount of coffee/water and then wait until the coffee is brewed (4 minutes) it’s a pain. The biggest issue is that there is no programmable timer for the water tank/brew cycle.Here’s a suggestion for the Bunn engineers: put a programmable timer on the water tank at least. In the morning nobody wants to wait 15 minutes or more for coffee to be ready. Such a simple modification would’ve made me keep this unit rather than return it. Mr. Coffee figured it out using a simpler machine. Surely Bunn can do the same to eliminate the 15 minute delay."
"While their commercial line is excellent, I would avoid this model.  Poor materials used in construction and has no user friendliness. The plate warmer is not automatic, which is a real problem if you forget to turn it off.  The carafe is too small.  Overall a very poor value."
I gave this unit a 3 star rating only because of the on-off light being a dark blue and about the size of a pencil lead. It is impossible to see and has caused us to leave the pot on overnight . Why they used a dark blue light instead of a red or green light on a black case is ridiculous.
"It brews quickly, but I feel like I use more coffee to get the strength I like. That said,  my biggest complaint is that it doesn’t have a stop drip when you remove the pot. You have to wait till every last drip comes out, before you grab a cup otherwise it drips on the element. Honestly for the price,  it’s a pretty basic  coffee pot. It looks nice and the no drip spout on the pot itself is great,  but I probably wouldn’t buy another one."

I've had a Bunn coffee maker on my kitchen counter for more than 30 years. This one is my third and I'm sure I'll get my money's worth. The coffee is good. The machine works as quickly as I need it to and I'm used to the way the system operates (top fill and close the lid to begin brewing coffee). My complaint is about the location of the warming switch. It's at the bottom of the machine in the front. I have inadvertently turned this switch off or on at least seven times during the past 2 weeks because I'm using my countertop.  I wish I would have stuck to the machine that had the warmer switch at the top.
"The burner is too hot, after an hour the coffee is turning rancid.  The brew water is not quite hot enough so the coffee is less than perfect to start with.  The burner switch is down low with a half a lumen LED you will never remember to switch on or off anyway.  It makes coffee.  Not the most excellent perfectly brewed and warmed coffee of my old 1st generation Bunn, but since they discontinued it, I couldn't buy replacement parts and had to throw it away.  I am a coffee snob and this is, to me a disappointing product from what used to be a premier company."
"Coffee maker worked as described for approximately two weeks.  I followed the instructions and flushed and cleaned the coffee maker.  Again, it worked for another two weeks.  As before, it began to take about 10 minutes to make a pot of coffee.  Went through the same process with the same results.  Today, I am going to purchase another coffee maker but it will not be a Bunn.  I previously had a Bunn and it worked great for several years, but unfortunately, I can't say the same thing for their newer products."
I have not been able to get through a cup of coffee without using the microwave. The coffee isn't hot enough for the first or second cup. I really wanted to stick with Bunn but my old one stopped making hot coffee so I ordered this new one. Same problem. After many decades I'm going to need to change brands. I'm so disappointed.
"This is our 3rd Bunn coffee maker. We love the speed. This particular one seems to brew too cooly, resulting in weak coffee. I have too put a lot more grounds in the basket to get the proper results. But, the biggest downfall of this machine is the WARMER LIGHT IS TOO SMALL/DIM to see from even a few feet away. This results in the warmer being left on unintentionally. Because it does not have an auto-shutoff, this could cook your coffee all the way down and destroy your carafe - maybe even cause a fire?"
"Being a Bunn coffee maker I thought that it would last a long time. Shortly after the 1 year mark we noticed water/coffee under the machine, which we played it off as possible spill on our end. After that it started taking a little bit longer to brew coffee (not a big deal). Ultimately it started taking over an hour to brew a half of a pot of coffee and there would be a puddle of coffee or water under the machine. Not worth the amount of money we paid and certainly did not last long at all."
"Coffee has pooled on the underside of the unit, but didn't not spread beyond the unit it itself.  We noticed this just after the 30 day return policy.  The stone counter top is permanently stained and I can no longer return this POS.  We previously had a two pot BUNN machine that was great.  It was about 12 years old, but we no longer needed such a large unit.  We make 5 pots of coffee a week.  What a disappointment!!!!"
I ordered one that said like new in orginal box and packaging.  It came in the original box but the unit had a broken heating plate.  It was in two pieces.  It clearly was sent to me broken because the box was fine.  Now I have to go through the return process and start over.
"I've previously owned a Bunn and was very satisified. But, the one I just received has a definite problem. It does not have an automatic shut-off on the warmer. As most people, we occassional forget to turn the warmer off manually and this causes the remaining coffee to burn in the pot which is alot of scrubbing to remove. I would not have ordered if I had know this. Poor design......"
"Bought a Bunn, for the brand recognition. Coffee pot has no timer (that one is on me, because I missed this obvious detail in the description). Then I realized I can't remove the pot while it's brewing, because it has no flow stop. I was willing to live with this problem too. Then I went to fill the coffee filter and water, setting up for morning when I woke up. Without turning anything on, water began flowing through the filter as soon as I closed the fill lid. So you can't close the fill lid, until you're ready to brew coffee, meaning you can't set this up the night before, so you can wake up to made coffee, which is the whole reason I bought this thing! Then when I went to drain it, draining took 15 minutes to get all the water out of the resevoir... Maybe there's someone out there who would love this thing, but it isn't me."
"I’ve had this coffee maker for a couple of weeks now and I have mixed feelings. It does make good coffee and it does it quickly, however I have never had a coffee maker be so loud! Right after it gets done brewing it starts making this loud “steaming” sound that you can hear throughout the house. It lasts anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes! Extremely strange. Not sure I want to listen to that all winter when the windows are closed and there is no outside noise to muffle it!"
"This 10 cup is way to small for just the 2 of us, we wanted a 14 cup but then it goes into commercial, so we had to make another pot for our 2 cups each,, you can not make and set for morning brewing, no settings at all! NONE, you have to leave it on at all time and if you leave to be sure and shut it off before you go,cant get to reservoirs to clean, ONLY thing we did like is no steam coming out of it, just very displeased with it over all,so we returned,"
This coffee machine did not last more than 5 months with minimal use at our vacation house. The warranty  people were extremely rude and practically said it was old. My Mr Coffee pot from Walmart is still working after 7 yrs. I was just upgrading it but ended up bringing the Mr Coffee back out. This is a piece of junk and so is their warranty. Clogged and drips right through. Don’t spend your money
"In the Past- -Bunn had a GREAT product. I am so sad to report the newest Elite machine does NOT heat the water hot enough to brew well.  Even my instant coffee-taste better than the brew BUT I still have to put it in the microwave to get it hot enough to be tasteful. UNLESS This changes???  I will be calling the customer service Dept. Monday, Don't know what they can do at this point.  I am sure that I will be buying a different coffee maker-It will cost more-but SO what-At least I will have a tasty cup.water out to brew is 180 degrees. and in the brew in the pot is 175.But the machine is a pretty counter top decoration. What good it that????????"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Everytime I go to warm the water up like it says to do for approx 15 mins.. it starts to sound like a damn train whistle and is extremely annoying and completely unnecessary. If I could return it and get something different I would. Maybe I just got a bad one out of the bunch, definitely taking a gamble on a train horn rather than a coffee maker if you’re considering it a buy. BEWARE!"
Great coffee maker however they sent the unit with 12 cup filters so they don’t fit right
brand names are junk!  extremely basic model for $160 and it didnt even drip!
I pour water into it and it just leaks the water out into the pot. I close the lid to “start the brew” and then I get cold light tea colored coffee even after leaving the power on over night to get the water in the reservoir hot.
"I’ve always used the bunn coffee makers.  The one I have now I’ve had for 15 years.  I ordered this particular bunn machine but was terribly disappointed in the quality of the machine.  The plastic they use now to manufacture it is cheap and lightweight.  It has a dullness to it. Mine has shiny thick plastic and a heavy duty stainless steel reservoir for the hot water.  This one even came with a flimsy stainless steel reservoir. I bought instead a mocccamaster which I bought on sale from wayfair. Instead of paying $349, I got it for $239.  A few more bucks than the bunn.  And with a 5 year warranty.  Who does that? So boo on bunn."
I love my Bunn coffee maker however this particular model has a design flaw. The light on the power button is tiny and dim. It is very difficult to see and it is very easy to leave on. The older model had a visible light that made it harder to accidentally leave on
"This is so lightweight plastic.  I'm used to a heavy Bunn that I had for over 7 years.  This looks cheaply made, and picture shows silver accent in carafe area, but is in fact BLUE!  Not what I expected for a Bunn, but does perform fast."
See above.  Will asap.
"Have loved our last Brunn I've had for 20+ years, but this one is not as good as their previous models. Doesn't hold as much water as our previous model, don't like the shape of the pot, plus  the pot lip doesn't pour out well. The spray head into the basket for coffee grounds only streams water in instead of spraying over the grounds like a shower head which effects the flavor/seeping of the coffee grounds. Overall, very disappointed in this newer model and I'm seriously thinking about sending it back."
"Whoever approved putting the Bunn name on this very low end nonworking product, just why?I wanted basic coffee, I jumped through all the setup hoops and nothing happened. The overwhelming smell of cheap plastic was the icing. if you read this review and still want to purchase know when you go to return it you’ll be waiting minimum two weeks as you’ll be schlepping this thing to a UPS not the convenience of Wholefoods.Flimsy thin plastic machine that just doesn’t work."
This coffee pot is not great at all! The grounds go all over and spills in the coffee - I always have to clean above the basket area EVERY SINGLE time we make coffee - if I could return I Would- I missed my return window by a day !Waste of money 💰
"The first time I brewed a pot the temperature of the coffee was 174 degrees. Then I started to use hot water instead of cold and the temperature went up to 180. I finally got it to 184 which is not hot enough for me. Had to put it in the microwave. When you read what brewing temperatures should be, 195-205 degrees, this coffee maker misses the mark. When I drained it the water seemed hotter then what it actually brews. So I think the new water mixes with the already heated water and brings down the brewing heat. Or there is something wrong with the heating element. I have returned it."
For the price of this thing its not worth it. It brews coffee that's not hot enough.  I have to heat my cup of coffee up in the microwave for 30 seconds after I make it.  The coffee also doesn't have enough flavor so I find I have to use double the amount of coffee I'd use in my old Mr. Coffee.  I thought I was buying high quality when I purchased a Bunn coffee maker.  Highly disappointed!  Waste of money!
"There are many cons to this coffee maker, especially for the above average cost to buy. I’ll list, first you are making coffee for the following day so if you wish to make a half pot of coffee you can not. The warming plate does not automatically shut off after a period of time. It’s small 10 cup capacity, I thought it would need less ground coffee to make an average strength pot of coffee, it does not. You can not add water to maker the night before, no clock. Also the flavor is not much better than the 27.00 dollar black and decker I had before this. Definitely not worth the money."
This coffee maker is a huge disappointment! The speed brew functionality is not really true in that you have to wait 15 minutes for the water in the reservoir to heat up. Then the coffee goes through the grounds so fast that it makes weak coffee and if you ad more grounds to compensate then the grounds overflow the Bunn filters and you end up with grounds and sediment in the coffee!Once the coffee is made it heats up the water again so you are using energy to heat more water and If you are not making another pot this is wasted.
"I have been an avid fan of Bunn for years. I love how quickly Bunn's brew, and I was excited to see this new model. Unfortunately, this new model was slower than my 3-year-old Bunn BX ""ole trusty"" right out of the gate. This issue has progressively gotten worse. Now it takes 7-10 minutes to brew a pot of coffee, and there's an additional 2 minutes of excessive dripping when you pull the carafe out to pour a cup. Unfortunately, I am outside of my return period (purchased in Dec 22). However, it has reached the point where I just bought another BX model and will most likely toss this one."
"Lousy directions. condescending customer service by Angela. Even after speaking to her and understanding what I was doing wrong, my coffee came out weak.  I very much dislike not knowing how full it is, and having to keep trying to add water to get a full carafe. I like the size and appearance, but that's it.  It's going back!"
The Bunn works well enough. The problem is with the lack of power on light to remind you that it is still on. It has a tiny dull little blue light you can’t see unless you are right on top of it.
"Despite following set up routine, following directions for brewing, nothing ever brewed except a few drops appeared on the grounds.  Returning."
Will not recommend to others. Stopped working the way it was intended.
"Bad design,  the blue on/off light is literally  barely visible, making it difficult to see if burner is on or off.The coffee brews fine, not as fast as my old BUNN.  BUT THE MAIN SOURCE OF DISSATISFACTION, is that the blue on off light is out after 6 months and the company will replace but you are responsible for return shipping, This is a large box and the Bunn people thought it would be $25 to return depending where you are shipping from.  In my opinion it will be more than that.  I will not ever buy another BUNN due to poor customer service."
"I had high hopes for this coffee maker and after a half dozen uses it continues to randomly leak from the bottom area when not in use. It has stained my wooden counter, and I must say, I expected a lot more for the cost and from Bunn, the maker of this item. Absolutely not worth it."
"The listing from Amazon’s warehouse said the coffee maker was never opened and there was no damage to the box. I was saving $15 bucks. However it arrived completely smashed through Bunn’s double boxing. Amazon put it in a 3rd box to contain the broken glass. What a complete waste of everyone’s time. Needless to say, I returned it and bought a Cosori electric kettle instead. I’ve been using a Bunn to heat water for tea for years. Turns out electric kettles can do the same job in 3 mins for 1/4 of the cost."
"Loved this coffee pot while it lasted but the fact that it has only been 6 months since purchased and it does not work at all now, is so disappointing."
We have had bunn and all worked great. This one keeps leaking. We are outside the 30 day window to exchange so we are out $175
"I relied upon the reputation of Bunn as the primary reason for buying this coffee maker. The set up and directions were odd and incomplete. Some things were spelled out and others left us with questions. We did the initial set up but after 2 tries, the coffee maker did not respond properly and the resulting coffee was luke warm at best and the warmer well exceeded the time they claimed would allow the coffee to warm. Bad model and bad design. Very disappointing."
"It usually makes hot coffee, but every few pots of coffee you get cold coffee. The water reserve light is on but the water is not hot. Now a lot of times if it makes hot coffee the element under the carafe will not keep the coffee hot. This was a waste of money and very disappointed in Bunn, I have used Bunn coffee makers since the 90s but they have cheapened the quality, and I can't afford to waste money on a product that is not dependable and have problems after just 5 or 6 weeks of making one pot of coffee per day. I just hope it is not a fire hazard."
I've always used Bunn and they have always lasted for several years. This one is not even a year old yet and the water is not disbursing over all of the grounds and instead is just dripping a straight line of water which then requires I use a lot more coffee grounds and still get weak coffee. It is also taking 10 mins to brew instead of the 3 it used to take. It is also leaking water. I've tried cleaning it out and taking all the steps recommended in the help but nothing has helped. Super disappointed I bought the upgraded model and it didn't last even a year.
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE BREWER ON ALL THE TIME THE COFFEE IS NOT HOT ENOUGH
"Tried for several days following the instructions and waiting for coffee. Nothing comes out. I think that maybe it doesn't get hot enough ? Perhaps If it gets too hot it might melt the cheap plastic it is made from.  Anyway, I'm returning it and not buying another BUNN Product again."
"Burner ""on"" light is not at all noticeable. The light is blue and blends in with the color of the switch. You can barely tell it is on."
hard to set up
"I cannot explain how dissapointed I am with my Bunn coffee pot.I purchased one in Sept. 18,2023. It literally ran the water sooooo slow and in turn the taste of the coffee was GROSS.The worse part is I bought another one this week. At $149.00, NOT AGAIN! I always heard that the Bunn Coffee pot was the best,  NOW I have my doubts. This should have lasted for several years!"
Bunn's are supposed to be the best coffee makers?? This is by far the worst & most expensive coffee maker that we have ever purchased. I'm not sure if we just got a maker that malfunctions or what but we never get the amount of coffee out equaled to the amount of water put in. We have wasted so many coffee grounds & had so many pots of watered down coffee.......UGH!!
Water filler lid was broken and can't find a replacement.
"Love Bun Coffee Makers have had them for 35 years in our home and restaurant.  This model I wouldn't purchase again due to the tiny blue 'on light'.  So easy to miss, have forgotten it many times already both to turn on & off.  The large red 'on light' in a more prominent position was much smarter!"
Takes too long to heat and brew. Over 15 minutes. Warmer cuts off too soon. Centrifugal flow. You can't cut off to get a cup of coffee until brewing is complete. DONT make the mistake of not having the carafe in place. The carafe does not initiate Coffee flow. Coffee flows on the counter. A mess
"It has a truly weird process for making coffee. You have to pour water in and guess how long it will take it to possibly, maybe get hot. Once you get to your guess timeline, you can close the door and wait on it to make coffee.It may actually drip into the container faster than a normal drip coffee maker, but sheesh, by the time you've waited on it for every step, you've wasted a good ten minutes more than you ever did with a cheap little $20 walmart special.Save your money"
"By the time the maker stops dripping, it's 15 minutes to brew 10 cups of coffee. There is no stop to pour a cup, and after 13, 14, 15 minutes, you have to put down a towel to catch the running and dripping. Horrible decision; horrible maker. $15 generic maker is back out of the cupboard and is 10 times better."
The coffee pot makes excellent coffee but the light showing whether or not it’s on or not is on the very bottom of the pot and the light is not bright at all. I’ve actually left it on several times and it’s a fire hazard. It’s very dangerous. I’d like to return it and get another Mr. Coffee but since I bought it in March I’m not eligible for returning it. The company needs to be aware that the on blue light is so faint you can barely see it.
When I unboxed coffeemaker is was very dirty all over even where the coffee would come out like it was stored in a dirty warehouse. When I buy something new in the box I would think it would be clean and new this looked like it was used. Very unhappy I was looking forward to my new coffeemaker
Makes very weak coffee. No way to adjust. Going back to a Calphalon
"I have buying bunn coffee makers my whole adult life. 1st time dissatisfied.the drip takes longer than any regular drip. And it seems lukewarm. Ive tried for 4 mos now and i cant use this any longer. I think faulty since my other bunns were fast, hot, great."
"I’ve had a Bunn coffee pot for the last five years, decided to upgrade to this new one and every time that I turn the warmer off for the day, it leaks 1/4 to a half cup of water out of the top brew hole. If I don’t keep the pot under their spills out onto the burner and my counter."
the coffe comes out like water even if I use 3/4 cup of grounds the coffee will still be clear enough that you can see threw it and the design blows my mind how stupid it was made
"This item was supposed to have been reconditioned, but that was BS. If it's electronic, don't believe them when they say it was reconditioned. This coffee maker is also a dinosaur, as it has to be preheated and the hotplate doesn't heat unless the whole unit is on. Absolute junk."
About a month after Amazon's return window the Bunn started leaking and not just a little bit. We now have a small lake of coffee under the unit each morning. This is our first Bunn and we really wanted to like it. The coffee is good but obviously poor quality control. We will be contacting Bunn customer service.
"I am very disappointed with this Bunn brewing system. I expected a much higher quality in the use & appearance. Bunn is known for quick brewing & it does brew pretty fast but you also have to use much more coffee. If you are looking for a less than average coffee pot, this is it. Truly a let-down & discredit to my kitchen. Incredibly cheap. I should have returned it."
Bought for my husband for Christmas and not like coffee is brittle .would like return if possible
Brew is too fast for coffee extraction. The flavor is always weak no matter how I adjust the grind or coffee dose. This machine is great for you if you don't care about flavor and only care about speed. Also DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER! I returned this months ago and the seller has ignored it won't process a refund.
"So disappointed! We have only had our pot since the end of April, it has almost completely stopped brewing. I have never spent this much money on a coffee pot. So so sad."
"My brand of trust for drip coffeemakers was always Mr Coffee, but not anymore. My 'old design' 4 cup machine lasted almost 10 years. That model had been discontinued, so I bought this 'new model' on Amazon in February 2023, and it was a hassle from day one until it died today (November 8 2024)- after barely 19 months.The reason for that is BAD DESIGN. The drip arm is not attached to the lid like on the old model, but swings around and has to be adjusted by hand, and the basket fits in ONE SPECIFIC WAY, and WOE if it isn't sitting right, and that blasted swing arm isn't exactly aligned, and the user doesn't notice that! Then, the coffee spills out & leaks all over -and into the machine, including the on-off -brew later -and time setting buttons, which are ""CONVENIENTLY"" located horizontally at the bottom, so moisture from cleaning gets on- and in.This happened several times, and might be the reason why the controls finally fried out. BESIDES that, replacement carafes and water filter discs are nowhere available like other reviewers pointed out, and the cost of the machine went from $22 when I bought it last year to $39.I ordered a machine from another brand that is constructed like the old style Mr. Coffee ones: Drip arm attached to the lid, basket assembly just drops in, and the on-off button is mounted vertically & up on the side. Oh, and it costs less, too. Unfortunately it cannot be set to make coffee automatically, but at this point hassle free use is more important for my wife & me, and hopefully it also will last a little longer!"
"I’ve had Mr. Coffee coffee makers for years.  I bought this one when my 4 cup Mr. Coffee finally stopped working after many years of great service.  The first thing I noticed was that I have to buy my filters on Amazon because the filters you buy in the grocery store are too tall for the filter basket.  I had to trim the tops off of the remaining filters I had in order to use them up.  The carafe has two problems - it dribbles down the side when you pour your coffee unless you pour very slowly and I have coffee stains on the inside of the glass carafe that can’t be scrubbed off with dish soap and scouring sponge.  I haven’t tried it yet, but I will try cleaning it with vinegar to see if that will remove the stains. The positives are that it makes a great cup of coffee and I like the auto set feature.  The filters are the biggest issue for me and once this Mr. Coffee bites the dust I will probably buy a different coffee maker brand that can use store bought filters."
"I love the option of pot vs. k-cup, and I love that it's the original Keurig brand. Just be sure pour a cup from the pot over the sink, otherwise, coffee will puddle on your counter top and make a mess."
"This coffee pot was shipped in plain brown box. It was not packaged in a Mr.  Coffee box and did not have any Mr. Coffee pamphlets or booklets. The actual coffeemaker looks new, or at least clean.I'd have it replaced if it wasn't difficult for me to take and return."
"I love this coffee pot honestly, I live in an apt by myself and just drink 1 or 2 cups a day. However, me and everyone else is unable to find the correct size for the water filtration disks. I would recommend buying it if you don’t care about that, cause I’ve looked everywhere on here for it and I am unable to find it."
"One of the reasons I purchased this Mr. Coffee maker model was it included the carbon-based water filtration system that during the brewing process helps remove up to 97% of the chlorine from the water and improves the taste of your coffee. I had this on the 12-cup model I was replacing and wanted to continue having this feature. You rinse this replaceable filter daily, and replace it monthly or after 50 pots of coffee. Imagine my surprise and dismay when I tried to buy replacement filters that they had been discontinued! What? I buy a new unit and an important feature is unusable? 2. It does not have a setting to choose the strength of your coffee between regular or strong. I would be perfectly happy with this unit if it wasn't for these two issues. It has a Reusable Filter, ability to Brew Now or Brew Later, Grab a Cup auto pause, & a 2 hr shut off. I have included a photo to show the filter size difference between the  5-cup model and the 12-cup model. You can buy packages of the filters here on Amazon that says ""it fits all models"" but that is not correct as it does not fit the 5-cup model."
"Update from my last review…I’m needing to replace the water filtration disc, however, I can only find replacements that fit the larger models. The disc for the 5-cup is an inch smaller than the ones you can find. I contacted Mr. Coffee directly and was brushed off to a replacement parts website where they don’t have the smaller ones either. Not happy with their customer service at all and if they don’t make the proper size replacements, then don’t include them with the pot!I had the 4-cup Mr. Coffee Coffee Maker for over 20 years and it just stopped working and I needed a replacement. I like that the buttons are bigger on this machine than the old one and everything seemed easier to set. I also like that I can forget to close the top cover but water will still come through since the reservoir isn't connected through the lid like the old one. The water filter is a new touch but I haven't figured out if it helps the taste of the coffee yet or not. I guess I can brew a pot without it and compare. All in all, I'm quite pleased with this one and can only hope it lasts as long as the other one."
"This is a small, basic coffee maker (which is fine for me because it's what I needed for my limited counter space). I've used it several times now and it works well. There wasn't a manual or any assembly instructions included with the shipment but I guess it's mostly common sense. I was surprised at how cheap the plastic is, and the pot itself is thin glass that wouldn't survive rough handling or a fall. Overall it's an okay product for the price, but I had hoped for better build quality from a Mr. Coffee. But you get what you pay for."
It says 5 cups but only 2-3 cup size.
"Good machine, but very difficult to add the water and coffee if you are left handed. The lid opens up to the left and blocks your hand from getting inside."
"The carafe always spills when I pour coffee or water from it, which is a problem for both my spouse and me. My last coffee maker didn't have this problem, so I'm going to have to replace this with a different brand."
"I really wish a company would not change a good thing.  My old Mr Coffee, even though it was 4 cup, you could access it from both sides when pouring water in and didn’t need to move the spout.  The place where I have mine in the kitchen is pretty much right up against my fridge on the left side, which makes it more difficult when pouring the water in.  Plus it is not as good for left handed people like my husband.  I believe cleaning this model will be more difficult.  The old model you could clean the spout since it lifted up with the lid.  This one does not hinge up for proper cleaning, and when you live in an area with hard water as we do, it would be nice if you could clean it better.  Also, now you have to move the spout over before closing the lid.  I’ve tried just closing the lid w/o moving the spout, and by just doing this, it does move the spout over, but not as completely as I’d like.  On a good note, my coffee tastes the same with minor adjustments.  Also, the carafe pours nicely without spilling all over the place.  And of course I like the warming plate, as some other brands don’t have that for some of their smaller models.  Change can be good, but not in this case."
I have loved all of my previous Mr. Coffee pots. This one has black numbers (hard to see the time). The basket doesn't hold enough grounds for 4 cups of strong coffee. I always have grounds and sometimes sediment in my coffee. I've tried using a 5 cup filter - still overflows. I've cleaned the reservoir. I only need a 5 cup coffee maker. I've this one. Can't give it back. I'm going to have to buy a 12 cup coffee maker to get a decent 4 cups of coffee. I'm so disappointed. No auto stop if I remove the canister before it's finished percolating.
Coffee has to be a little hotter.I still like it.cheaper at Walmart.
"I don’t usually write negative reviews because I like everything I buy, but I hate this coffee maker.I’ve had many coffee makers and this one is simple like I wanted, but WHY did they have to design it so blatantly for right handers?!?!?!. It’s like they went out of their way to make it exclusively for right hand use.I hate getting coffee ready in it. I feel like I am back in grade school trying to contort my body and limbs so I can somehow write, at the  only desks available; the “right handed” desks."
"I'm concerned as to why this coffee pot arrived in a generic brown box, rather than an actual Mr. Coffee box that you should get when buying new. I'm skeptical if this is a used or defective one. I will be sending back since it is a gift, and I don't want to take a chance of gifting them with a used model but paying new price."
